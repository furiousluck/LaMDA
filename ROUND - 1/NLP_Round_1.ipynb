       "'an operating system is a program that manages the computer hardware it  also provides a basis for application programs and acts as an intermediary  between the computer user and the computer hardware an amazing aspect  of operating systems is how varied they are in accomplishing these tasks  mainframe operating systems are designed primarily to optimize utilization  of hardware personal computer pc operating systems support complex  games business applications and everything in between operating systems  for handheld computers are designed to provide an environment in which a  user can easily interface with the computer to execute programs thus some  operating systems are designed to be convenient others to be efficient and others  some combination of the two  before we can explore the details of computer system operation we need  to know something about system structure we begin by discussing the basic  functions of system startup i and storage we also describe the basic  computer architecture that makes it possible to write a functional operating  system  because an operating system is large and complex it must be created  piece by piece each of these pieces should be a well delineated portion of the  system with carefully defined inputs outputs and functions in this chapter  we provide a general overview of the major components of an operating  system  to provide a grand tour of the major components of operating systems  to describe the basic organization of computer systems  we begin our discussion by looking at the operating system s role in the  overall computer system a computer system can be divided roughly into     chapter  compiler assembler text editor  operating system database  system  figure abstract view of the components of a computer system  four components the hardware the operating system the application programs  and the users figure   the hardwa te the the and the  basic computing resources for the  system the as word processors spreadsheets  compilers and web browsers define the ways in which these resources are  used to solve users computing problems the operating system controls the  hardware and coordinates its use among the various application programs for  the various users  we can also view a computer system as consisting of hardware software  and data the operating system provides the means for proper use of these  resources in the operation of the computer system an operating system is  similar to a government like a government it performs no useful function by  itself it simply provides an environment within which other programs can do  useful work  to understand more fully the operating systemfs role we next explore  operating systems from two viewpoints that of the user and that of the system   user view  the user s view of the computer varies according to the interface being  used most computer users sit in front of a pc consisting of a monitor  keyboard mouse and system unit such a system is designed for one user  to monopolize its resources the goal is to maximize the work or play that  the user is performing in this case the operating system is designed mostly  for with some attention paid to performance and none paid  to various hardware and software resources are  shared performance is of course important to the user but such systems    are optimized for the single user experience rather than the requirements of  multiple users  in other cases a user sits at a terminal connected to a or a  other users are accessing the sance computer through other  terminals these users share resources and may exchange information the  operating system in s llclc cases is designed to maximize resource utilization\\xad to assure that all available cpu time memory and i are used efficiently and  tbat no individual user takes more than her fair share  in still otber cases users sit at connected to networks of  other workstations and these users have dedicated resources at their  disposal but they also share resources such as networking and servers file  compute and print servers therefore their operating system is designed to  compromise between individual usability and resource utilization  recently many varieties of handheld computers have come into fashion  most of these devices are standalone units for individual users some are  connected to networks either directly by wire or more often through wireless  modems and networking because of power speed and interface limitations  they perform relatively few remote operations their operating systems are  designed mostly for individual usability but performance per unit of battery  life is important as well  some computers have little or no user view for example embedded  computers in home devices and automobiles may have numeric keypads and  may turn indicator lights on or off to show status but they and their operating  systems are designed primarily to run without user intervention   system view  from the computer s point of view the operating system is the program  most intimately involved with the hardware in this context we can view  an operating system as a a computer system has many  resources that may be required to solve a problem cpu time memory space  file storage space i devices and so on the operating system acts as the  manager of these resources facing numerous and possibly conflicting requests  for resources the operating system must decide how to allocate them to specific  programs and users so that it can operate the computer system efficiently and  fairly as we have seen resource allocation is especially important where many  users access the same mainframe or minicomputer  a slightly different view of an operating system emphasizes the need to  control the various i devices and user programs an operating system is a  control program a manages the execution of user programs  to prevent errors and improper use of the computer it is especially concerned  with the operation and control of i o devices   defining operating systems  we have looked at the operating system s role from the views of the user  and of the system how though can we define what an operating system  is in general we have no completely adequate definition of an operating  system operating systems exist because they offer a reasonable way to solve  the problem of creating a usable computing system the fundamental goal  of computer systems is to execute user programs and to make solving user   chapter   storage definitions and notation  a is the basic unit of computer storage it can contain one of two values  zero and one all other storage in a computer is based on collections of bits  given enough bits it is amazing how many things a computer can represent  numbers letters images movies sounds documents and programs to name  a few a is bits and on most computers it is the smallest convenient  chunk of storage for example most computers don t have an instruction  to move a bit but do have one to move a byte a less common term is  which is a given computer architecture s native storage unit a word is  generally made up of one or more bytes for example a computer may have  instructions to move bit byte words  a kilobyte or kb is bytes a megabyte or mb is bytes and  a gigabyte or gb s bytes computer manufacturers often round off  these numbers and say that a megabyte is million bytes and a gigabyte is  billion bytes  problems easier toward this goal computer hardware is constructed since  bare hardware alone is not particularly easy to use application programs are  developed these programs require certain common operations such as those  controlling the ii devices the common functions of controlling and allocating  resources are then brought together into one piece of software the operating  system  in addition we have no universally accepted definition of what is part of the  operating system a simple viewpoint is that it includes everything a vendor  ships when you order the operating system the features included however  vary greatly across systems some systems take up less than megabyte of  space and lack even a full screen editor whereas others require gigabytes of  space and are entirely based on graphical windowing systems a more common  definition and the one that we usually follow is that the operating system  is the one program running at all times on the computer usually called  the along with the kernel there are two other types of programs  which are associated with the operating system but are not  part of the kernel and which include all programs not  associated with the operation of the system  the matter of what constitutes an operating system has become increas\\xad ingly important in the united states deparhnent of justice filed suit  against microsoft in essence claiming that microsoft included too much func\\xad tionality in its operating systems and thus prevented application vendors from  competing for example a web browser was an integral part of the operating  systems as a result microsoft was found guilty of using its operating system  monopoly to limit competition  before we can explore the details of how computer systems operate we need  general knowledge of the structure of a computer system in this section  we look at several parts of this structure the section is mostly concerned    the study ofoperating systems   computer system operation  a modern general purpose computer system consists of one or more cpus  and a number of device controllers connected through a common bus that  provides access to shared memory figure  each device controller is in  charge of a specific type of device for example disk drives audio devices and  video displays the cpu and the device controllers can execute concurrently  competing for memory cycles to ensure orderly access to the shared memory  a memory controller is provided whose function is to synchronize access to the  memory  for a computer to start rum ing for instance when it is powered  up or rebooted it needs to have an initial program to run this initial   chapter  mouse keyboard printer monitor  program or tends to be simple typically it is stored  in read only memory or electrically erasable programmable read only  memory known by the general term within the computer  hardware it initializes all aspects of the system from cpu registers to device  controllers to memory contents the bootstrap program must know how to load  the operating system and how to start executing that system to accomplish this  goal the bootstrap program must locate and load into memory the operating\\xad system kernel the operating system then starts executing the first process  such as init and waits for some event to occur  the occurrence of an event is usually signaled by an from either  the hardware or the software hardware may trigger an interrupt at any time  by sending a signal to the cpu usually by way of the system bus software  may trigger an interrupt executing a special operation called a   also called a  when the cpu is interrupted it stops what it is doing and immediately  transfers execution to a fixed location the fixed location usually contains  the starting address where the service routine for the interrupt is located  the interrupt service routine executes on completion the cpu resumes the  interrupted computation a time line of this operation is shown in figure  interrupts are an important part of a computer architecture each computer  design has its own interrupt mechanism but several functions are common  the interrupt must transfer control to the appropriate interrupt service routine  the straightforward method for handling this transfer would be to invoke a  generic routine to examine the interrupt information the routine in turn  would call the interrupt specific handler however interrupts must be handled  quickly since only a predefined number of interrupts is possible a table of  pointers to interrupt routines can be used instead to provide the necessary  speed the interrupt routine is called indirectly through the table with no  intermediate routine needed generally the table of pointers is stored in low  memory the first hundred or so locations these locations hold the addresses  of the interrupt service routines for the various devices this array or  of addresses is then indexed by a unique device number given with  the interrupt request to provide the address of the interrupt service routine for  cpu user  done transfer  request done  figure interrupt time line for a single process doing output  the interrupting device operating systems as different as windows and unix  dispatch interrupts in this manner  the interrupt architecture must also save the address of the interrupted  instruction many old designs simply stored the interrupt address in a  fixed location or in a location indexed by the device number more recent  architectures store the return address on the system stack if the interrupt  routine needs to modify the processor state for instance by modifying  register values it must explicitly save the current state and then restore that  state before returning after the interrupt is serviced the saved return address  is loaded into the program counter and the interrupted computation resumes  as though the interrupt had not occurred   storage structure  the cpu can load instructions only from memory so any programs to run must  be stored there general purpose computers run most of their programs from  rewriteable memory called main memory also called  or ram main commonly is implemented in a semiconductor  technology called computers use  other forms of memory as well because the read only memory rom camwt  be changed only static programs are stored there the immutability of rom  is of use in game cartridges eeprom camwt be changed frequently and so  contains mostly static programs for example smartphones have eeprom to  store their programs  all forms of memory provide an array of words each word has its  own address interaction is achieved through a sequence of load or store  instructions to specific memory addresses the load instruction moves a word  from main memory to an internal register within the cpu whereas the store  instruction moves the content of a register to main memory aside from explicit  loads and stores the cpu automatically loads instructions from main memory  for execution  a typical instruction execution cycle as executed on a system with a  architecture first fetches an from memory and stores  that instruction in the the instruction is then decoded  and may cause operands to be fetched from memory and stored in some   chapter  internal register after the instruction on the operands has been executed the  result may be stored back in memory notice that the memory unit sees only  a stream of memory addresses it does not know how they are generated by  the instruction counter indexing indirection literal addresses or some other  means or what they are for instructions or data accordingly we can ignore  how a memory address is generated by a program we are interested only in  the sequence of memory addresses generated by the running program  ideally we want the programs and data to reside in main ncemory  permanently this arrangement usually is not possible for the following two  reasons  main memory is usually too small to store all needed programs and data  permanently  main memory is a volatile storage device that loses its contents when  power is turned off or otherwise lost  thus most computer systems provide as an extension  of main memory the main requirement for secondary storage is that it be able  to hold large quantities of data permanently  the most common secondary storage device is a which  provides storage for both programs and data most programs system and  application are stored on a disk until they are loaded into memory many  programs then use the disk as both the source and the destination of their  processing hence the proper management of disk storage is of central  importance to a computer system as we discuss in chapter  in a larger sense however the storage structure that we have described\\xad consisting of registers main memory and magnetic disks is only one of many  possible storage systems others include cache memory cd rom magnetic  tapes and so on each storage system provides the basic functions of storing  a datum and holding that datum until it is retrieved at a later time the main  differences among the various storage systems lie in speed cost size and  volatility  the wide variety of storage systems in a computer system can be organized  in a hierarchy figure according to speed and cost the higher levels are  expensive but they are fast as we move down the hierarchy the cost per bit  generally decreases whereas the access time generally increases this trade off  is reasonable if a given storage system were both faster and less expensive  than another other properties being the same then there would be no  reason to use the slower more expensive memory in fact many early storage  devices including paper tape and core memories are relegated to museums  now that magnetic tape and have become faster and  cheaper the top four levels of memory in figure may be constructed using  semiconductor memory  in addition to differing in speed and cost the various storage systems  are either volatile or nonvolatile as mentioned earlier loses  its contents when the power to the device is removed in the absence of  expensive battery and generator backup systems data must be written to  for safekeeping in the hierarchy shown in figure the  the electronic disk are volatile whereas those below    figure symmetric multiprocessing architecture  solaris the benefit of this model is that many processes can run simultaneously   n processes can run if there are n cpus without causing a significant  deterioration of performance however we must carefully control i to  ensure that the data reach the appropriate processor also since the cpus  are separate one may be sitting idle while another is overloaded resulting in  inefficiencies these inefficiencies can be avoided if the processors share certain  data structures a multiprocessor system of this form will allow processes and  resources such as memory to be shared dynamically among the various  processors and can lower the variance among the processors such a system  must be written carefully as we shall see in chapter virtually all modern  operating systems including windows windows xp mac os x and linux   now provide support for smp  the difference between symmetric and asymmetric multiprocessing may  result from either hardware or software special hardware can differentiate the  multiple processors or the software can be written to allow only one master and  multiple slaves for instance sun s operating system sunos version provided  asymmetric multiprocessing whereas version solaris is symmetric on the  same hardware  multiprocessing adds cpus to increase computing power if the cpu has an  integrated memory controller then adding cpus can also increase the amount  of memory addressable in the system either way multiprocessing can cause  a system to change its memory access model from uniform memory access  to non uniform memory access uma is defined as the situation  in which access to any ram from any cpu takes the same amount of time with  numa some parts of memory may take longer to access than other parts  creating a performance penalty operating systems can minimize the numa  penalty through resource management as discussed in section   a recent trend in cpu design is to in clude multiple computing on  a single chip in essence these are multiprocessor chips they can be more  efficient than multiple chips with single cores because on chip communication  is faster than between chip communication in addition one chip with multiple  cores uses significantly less power than multiple single core chips as a result  multicore systems are especially well suited for server systems such as database  and web servers   chapter  figure a dual core design with two cores placed on the same chip  in figure we show a dual core design with two cores on the same  chip in this design each core has its own register set as well as its own local  cache other designs might use a shared cache or a combination of local and  shared caches aside from architectural considerations such as cache memory  and bus contention these multicore cpus appear to the operating system  as n standard processors this tendency puts pressure on operating system  designers and application programmers to make use of those cpus  finally are a recent development in which multiple processor  boards i boards and networking boards are placed in the same chassis  the difference between these and traditional multiprocessor systems is that  each blade processor board boots independently and runs its own operating  system some blade server boards are n ultiprocessor as well which blurs the  lines between types of computers in essence these servers consist of multiple  independent multiprocessor systems   clustered systems  another type of multiple cpu system is the like multipro\\xad cessor systems clustered systems gather together multiple cpus to accomplish  computational work clustered systems differ from multiprocessor systems  however in that they are composed of two or more individual systems or  nodes joined together the definition of the term clustered is not concrete  many commercial packages wrestle with what a clustered system is and why  one form is better than another the generally accepted definition is that clus\\xad tered computers share storage and are closely linked via a jc h a ·o x   as described in section or a faster interconnect such as infiniband  clustering is usually used to provide service that is  service will continue even if one or more systems in the cluster fail high  availability is generally obtained by adding a level of redundancy in the  system a layer of cluster software runs on the cluster nodes each node can  monitor one or more of the others over the lan if the monitored machine  fails the monitoring machine can take ownership of its storage and restart the  applications that were running on the failed machine the users and clients of  the applications see only a brief interruption of service    beowulf clusters  beowulf clusters are designed for solving high performance computing  tasks these clusters are built using comm odi ty hard ware such as personal  computers that are connected via a simple local area network interestingly  a beowulf duster uses no one specific software package but rather consists  of a set of open source software libraries that allow the conputing nodes  in the cluster to communicate with one another thus there are a variety of  approaches for constructing a beowulf cluster although beowulf computing  nodes typically run the linux operating system since beowulf clusters  require no special hardware and operate using open source software that  is freely available they offer a low cost strategy for building a high  performance computing cluster in fact some beowulf clusters built from  collections of discarded personal computers are using ht mdreds of cornputing  nodes to solve computationally expensive problems in scientific computing  clusterin g can be structured or symmetrically in  one machine is in while the other is  rmming the applications the hot standby host machine does nothing but  monitor the active server if that server fails the hot standby host becomes the  active server in two or more hosts are rmming applications  and are monitoring each other this mode is obviously more efficient as it uses  all of the available hardware it does require that more than one application be  available to run  as a cluster consists of several  clusters may also be used to provide environ\\xad ments such systems can supply significantly greater computational power  than single processor or even smp systems because they are capable of running  an application concurrently on all computers in the cluster however appli  cations must be written to take advantage of the cluster by using  a technique known as which consists of dividing a program  into separate components that run in parallel on individual computers in the  cluster typically these applications are designed so that once each computing  node in the cluster has solved its portion of the problem the results from all  the nodes are combined into a final solution  other forms of clusters include parallel clusters and clustering over a  wide area network wan as described in section  parallel clusters allow  multiple hosts to access the same data on the shared storage because most  operating systems lack support for simultaneous data access by multiple hosts  parallel clusters are usually accomplished by use of special versions of software  and special releases of applications for example oracle real application  cluster is a version of oracle s database that has been designed to run on  a parallel cluster each machine runs oracle and a layer of software tracks  access to the shared disk each machine has full access to all data in the  database to provide this shared access to data the system must also supply  access control and locking to ensure that no conflicting operations occur this  function commonly known as a is included  in some cluster technology   chapter   interconnect interconnect  computer computer computer  figure general structure of a clustered system  cluster technology is changing rapidly some cluster products support  dozens of systems in a cluster as well as clustered nodes that are separated  by miles many of these improvements are made possible by   saj· is as described in section  which allow many systems  to attach to a pool of storage if the applications and their data are stored on  the san then the cluster software can assign the application to run on any  host that is attached to the san if the host fails then any other host can take  over in a database cluster dozens of hosts can share the same database greatly  increasing performance and reliability figure depicts the general structure  of a clustered system  now that we have discussed basic information about computer system orga\\xad nization and architecture we are ready to talk about operating systems  an operating system provides the envirorunent within which programs are  executed internally operating systems vary greatly in their makeup since  they are organized along many different lines there are however many  commonalities which we consider in this section  in a non multiprogrammed system the cpu would sit idle in  a multiprogrammed system the operatilcg system simply switches to and  executes another job when that job needs to wait the cpu is switched to  another job and so on eventually the first job finishes waiting and gets the  cpu back as long as at least one job needs to execute the cpu is never idle  this idea is common in other life situations a lawyer does not work for  only one client at a time for example while one case is waiting to go to trial  or have papers typed the lawyer can work on another case if he has enough  clients the lawyer will never be idle for lack of work idle lawyers tend to  become politicians so there is a certain social value in keeping lawyers busy  multiprogrammed systems provide an environment in which the various  system resources for example cpu memory and peripheral devices are  utilized effectively but they do not provide for user interaction with the  computer system which provides direct communication between the user and the system the  user gives instructions to the operating system or to a program directly using a  input device such as a keyboard or a mouse and waits for immediate results on  an output device  a time shared operating system allows many users to share the computer  simultaneously since each action or command in a time shared system tends  to be short only a little cpu time is needed for each user as the system switches  rapidly from one user to the next each user is given the impression that the  entire computer system is dedicated to his use even though it is being shared  among many users   chapter  memory and executing is called a when a process executes it typically  executes for only a short tirne it either finishes or needs to perform i  i may be interactive that is output goes to a display for the user and input  comes from a user keyboard mouse or other device since interactive i  typically runs at people speeds it may take a long time to complete input  for example may be bounded by the user s typing speed seven characters per  second is fast for people but incredibly slow for computers rather than let  the cpu sit idle as this interactive input takes place the operating system will  rapidly switch the cpu to the program of some other user  time sharing and multiprogramming require that several jobs be kept  simultaneously in memory if several jobs are ready to be brought into memory  and if there is not enough room for all of them then the system must choose  among them making this decision is which is discussed in  chapter when the operating system selects a job from the job pool it loads  that job into memory for execution having several programs in memory at the  same time requires some form of memory management which is covered in  chapters and in addition requires that their ability to affect one another be limited in all phases of the  operating system including process scheduling disk storage and memory  management these considerations are discussed throughout the text  in a time sharing system the operating system must ensure reasonable  response time which is sometimes accomplished through where  processes are swapped in and out of main memory to the disk a more common  method for achieving this goal  the main of the virtual memory scheme is that it enables users  to run programs that are larger than actual further it  abstracts main memory into a large uniform array of storage separating logical  as viewed by the user from physical memory this arrangement frees  programmers from concern over memory storage limitations  time sharing systems must also provide a file system chapters and  the file system resides on a collection of disks hence disk management must  be provided chapter also time sharing systems provide a mechanism for  protecting resources from inappropriate use chapter to ensure orderly  execution the system must provide mechanisms for job synchronization and  communication chapter and it may ensure that jobs do not get stuck in a  deadlock forever waiting for one another chapter  are no processes to execute no i devices to service and no users to whom  to respond an operating system will sit quietly waiting for something to  happen events are almost always signaled by the occurrence of an interrupt  or a trap  be performed the interrupt driven nature of an operating system defines  that system s general structure for each type of interrupt separate segments  of code in the operating system determine what action should be taken an  interrupt service routine is provided that is responsible for dealing with the  interrupt  since the operating system and the users share the hardware and software  resources of the computer system we need to make sure that an error in a  user program could cause problems only for the one program running with  sharing many processes could be adversely affected by a bug in one program  for example if a process gets stuck in an infinite loop this loop could prev ent  the correct operation of many other processes more subtle errors can occur  in a multiprogramming system where one erroneous program might modify  another program the data of another program or even the operating system  itself  without protection against these sorts of errors either the computer must  execute only one process at a time or all output must be suspect a properly  designed operating system must ensure that an incorrect or malicious  program cannot cause other program  dual mode operation in order to ensure the proper execution of the operating system we must be  able to distinguish between the execution of operating system code and user\\xad defined code the approach taken by most computer systems is to provide  hardware support that allows us to differentiate among various modes of  execution  at the very least we need two  and also called or  a bit called the is added to the hardware of the computer to  indicate the current mode kernel or user  viththeplode jit velrea jle  to distinguishbetween a task that is executed onbehalf of the operating system  aicd one that is executeci on behalfofthejjser when the computer systel ns  executing on behalf of a user application the system is in user mode however  when a user application requests a service from the operating system via a   system call it must transition from user to kernel mode to fulfill the request   this is shown in figure as we shall see this architectural enhancement is  useful for many other aspects of system operation as well  execute system call  figure i transition from user to kernel mode user mode   mode bit i  kernel mode   mode bit    chapter  at system boot time the hardware starts in kernel mode the operating  system is then loaded and starts user applications in user mode whenever a  trap or interrupt occurs the hardware switches from user mode to kernel mode   that is changes the state of the mode bit to thus whenever the operating  system gains control of the computer it is in kernel mode the system always  switches to user mode by setting the mode bit to before passing control to  a user program  the dual mode of operation provides us with the means for protecting the  operating system from errant users and errant users from one another  if an attempt is made to  execute a privileged instruction in user mode the hardware does not execute  the instruction but rather treats it as illegal and traps it to the operating system  the instruction to switch to kernel mode is an example of a privileged  instruction some other examples include i controt timer management and  interrupt management as we shall see throughout the text there are many  additional privileged instructions  we can now see the life cycle of instruction execution in a computer system  initial control resides in the operating system where instructions are executed  in kernel mode when control is given to a user application the mode is set to  user mode eventually control is switched back to the operating system via an  interrupt a trap or a system call  lf a system call is invoked in a variety of ways depending  on the functionality provided by the underlying processor in all forms it is the  method used by a process to request action by the operating system a system  call usually takes the form of a trap to a specific location in the interrupt vector  this trap can be executed by a generic trap instruction although some systems   such as the mips r family have a specific syscall instruction  the lack of a hardware supported dual mode can cause serious shortcom  ings in an operating system for instance ms dos was written for the intel   architecture which has no mode bit and therefore no dual mode a user  program ruming awry can wipe out the operating system by writing over it  with data and multiple programs are able to write to a device at the same time  with potentially disastrous results recent versions of the intel cpu do provide  dual mode operation accordingly most contemporary operating systems\\xad such as microsoft vista and windows xp as well as unix linux and solaris      take advantage of this dual mode feature and provide greater protection for  the operating system  once hardware protection is in place it detects errors that violate modes  these errors are normally handled by the operating system if a user program  fails in some way such as by making an attempt either to execute an illegal  instruction or to access memory that is not in the user s address space then  the hardware traps to the operating system the trap transfers control through  the interrupt vector to the operating system just as an interrupt does when  a program error occurs the operating system must terminate the program  abnormally this situation is handled by the same code as a user requested  abnormal termination an appropriate error message is given and the memory  of the program may be dumped the memory dump is usually written to a  file so that the user or programmer can examine it and perhaps correct it and  restart the program  a is generally implemented by a fixed rate clock and a counter  the operating system sets the counter every time the clock ticks the counter  is decremented when the counter reaches an interrupt occurs for instance  a bit counter with a millisecond clock allows interrupts at intervals from   millisecond to milliseconds in steps of millisecond  before turning over control to the user the operating system ensures  that the timer is set to interrupt  thus we can use the timer to prevent a user program from running too  long a simple technique is to il itialize a counter with the amount of time that a  program is allowed to run a program with a minute time limit for example  would have its counter initialized to every second the timer interrupts  and the counter is decremented by as long as the counter is positive control  is returned to the user program when the counter becomes negative the  operating system terminates the program for exceeding the assigned time  limit  a program does nothing unless its instructions are executed by a cpu a  program in execution as mentioned is a process a time shared user program  such as a compiler is a process a word processing program being run by an  individual user on a pc is a process a system task such as sending output  to a printer can also be a process or at least part of one for now you can  consider a process to be a job or a time shared program but later you will learn   chapter   that the concept is more general as we shall see in chapter it is possible  to provide system calls that allow processes to create subprocesses to execute  concurrent y  in addition to the various physical and logical resources that a process obtains when it is  created various initialization data input may be passed along for example  consider a process whose function is to display the status of a file on the screen  of a terminal the process will be given as an input the name of the file and will  execute the appropriate instructions and system calls to obtain and display  on the terminal the desired information when the process terminates the  operating system will reclaim any reusable resources   threads are covered in chapter the cpu executes one instruction of the  process after another until the process completes further at any time one  instruction at most is executed on behalf of the process thus although two  processes may be associated with the same program they are nevertheless  considered two separate execution sequences a multithreaded process has  multiple program counters each pointing to the next instruction to execute for  a given thread  a process is the unit of work in a system such a system consists of a  collection of processes some of which are operating system processes those  that execute system code and the rest of which are user processes those that  execute user code  the operating system is responsible for the following activities in connec\\xadtion with process management  scheduling processes and threads on the cpus  creating and deleting both user and system processes  suspending and resuming processes  providing mechanisms for process synchronization  providing mechanisms for process communication  we discuss process management techniques in chapters through  as we discussed in section  the main memory is central to the operation  of a modern computer system main memory is a large array of words or bytes  ranging in size from hundreds of thousands to billions each word or byte has  its own address main memory is a repository of quickly accessible data shared  by the cpu and i devices the central processor reads instructions from main     memory during the instruction fetch cycle and both reads and writes data from  main memory during the data fetch cycle on a von neumann architecture  as noted earlier the main memory is generallythe only large storage device  that the cpu is able to address and access directly for example for the cpu to  process data from disk those data mu st first be transferred to main n lemory  by cpu generated i calls in the same way instructions must be in memory  for the cpu to execute them  for a program to be executed it must be mapped to absolute addresses and  loaded into memory as the program executes it accesses program instructions  and data from memory by generating these absolute addresses eventually  the program terminates its memory space is declared available and the next  program can be loaded and executed  to improve both the utilization of the cpu and the speed of the computer s  response to its users general purpose computers must keep several programs  in memory creating a need for memory management many different memory\\xad management schemes are used these schemes reflect various approaches and  the effectiveness of any given algorithm depends on the situation in selecting a  memory management scheme for a specific system we must take into account  many factors especially the hardware design of the system each algorithm  requires its own hardware support  the operating system is responsible for the following activities in connec\\xad tion with memory management  keeping track of which parts of memory are currently being used and by  whom  deciding which processes or parts thereof and data to move into and out  of memory  allocating and deallocating memory space as needed  memory management techniques are discussed il chapters and  to make the computer system convenient for users the operating system  provides a uniform logical view of information storage the operating system  abstracts from the physical properties of its storage devices to define a logical  storage unit the file the operating system maps files onto physical media and  accesses these files via the storage devices   file system management  pile management is one of the most visible components of an operating system  computers can store information on several different types of physical media  magnetic disk optical disk and magnetic tape are the most common each  of these media has its own characteristics and physical organization each  medium is controlled by a device such as a disk drive or tape drive that  also has its own unique characteristics these properties include access speed  capacity data transfer rate and access method sequential or randmn   chapter  a file is a collection of related information defined by its creator commonly  files represent programs both source and object forms and data data files may  be numeric alphabetic alphanumeric or binary files may be free form for  example text files or they may be formatted rigidly for example fixed fields  clearly the concept of a file is an extremely general one  the operating system implements the abstract concept of a file by managing  mass storage media such as tapes and disks and the devices that control them  also files are normally organized into directories to make them easier to use  finally when multiple users have access to files it may be desirable to control  by whom and in what ways for example read write append files may be  accessed  the operating system is responsible for the following activities in connec\\xad tion with file management  creating and deleting files  creating and deleting directories to organize files  supporting primitives for manipulating files and directories  mapping files onto secondary storage  backing up files on stable nonvolatile storage media  file management teclmiques are discussed in chapters and   mass storage management  as we have already seen because main memory is too small to accommodate  all data and programs and because the data that it holds are lost when power  is lost the computer system must provide secondary storage to back up main  memory most modern computer systems use disks as the principal on line  storage medium for both programs and data most programs including  compilers assemblers word processors editors and formatters are stored  on a disk until loaded into memory and then use the disk as both the source  and destination of their processing hence the proper management of disk  storage is of central importance to a computer system the operating system is  responsible for the following activities in connection with disk management  free space management  storage allocation  disk scheduling  because secondary storage is used frequently it must be used efficiently the  entire speed of operation of a computer may hinge on the speeds of the disk  subsystem and the algorithms that manipulate that subsystem  there are however many uses for storage that is slower and lower in cost   and sometimes of higher capacity than secondary storage backups of disk  data seldom used data and long term archival storage are some examples  magnetic drives and their tapes and cd and dvd drives and platters are  typical devices the media tapes and optical platters vary  between write once read many times and read write formats    tertiary storage is not crucial to systern performance but it still must  be managed some operating systems take on this task while others leave  tertiary storage management to application prograns some of the functions  that operating systerns can provide include mounting and unmounting rnedia  in devices allocating and freeing the devices for exclusive use by processes  and migrating data from secondary to tertiary storage  techniques for secondary and tertiary storage management are discussed  in chapter   caching  is an important principle of computer systems information is  normally kept in some storage system such as main memory as it is used  it is copied into a faster storage system the cache on a temporary basis  when we need a particular piece of information we first check whether it is  in the cache if it is we use the information directly from the cache if it is not  we use the information from the source putting a copy in the cache under the  assumption that we will need it again soon  in addition internal programmable registers such as index registers  provide a high speed cache for main memory the programmer or compiler  implements the register allocation and register replacement algorithms to  decide which information to keep in registers and which to keep in main  memory there are also caches that are implemented totally in hardware  for instance most systems have an instruction cache to hold the instructions  expected to be executed next without this cache the cpu would have to wait  several cycles while an instruction was fetched from main memory for similar  reasons most systems have one or more high speed data caches in the memory  hierarchy we are not concerned with these hardware only caches in this text  since they are outside the control of the operating system  because caches have limited size is an important  design problem careful selection of the cache size and of a replacement policy  can result in greatly increased performance figure compares storage  performance in large workstations and small servers various replacement  algorithms for software controlled caches are discussed in chapter  typical size mb gb gb  implementation custom memory with on chip or off chip cmos dram magnetic disk  technology multiple ports cmos cmossram  access time ns     bandwidth mb sec     managed by compiler hardware operating system operating system  backed by cache main memory disk cd or tape  figure performance of various levels of storage   chapter  main memory can be viewed as a fast cache for secondary storage since  data in secondary storage must be copied into main memory for use and  data must be in main memory before being moved to secondary storage for  safekeeping the file system data which resides permanently on secondary  storage may appear on several levels in the storage hierarchy at the highest  level the operating system may maintain a cache of file system data in main  memory in addition electronic ram disks also known as  may be used for high speed storage that is accessed through the file system  interface the bulk of secondary storage is on magnetic disks the magnetic\\xad disk storage in turn is often backed up onto magnetic tapes or removable  disks to protect against data loss in case of a hard disk failure some systems  autoinatically archive old file data from secondary storage to tertiary storage  such as tape jukeboxes to lower the storage cost see chapter  the movement of information between levels of a storage hierarchy may  be either explicit or implicit depending on the hardware design and the  controlling operating system software for example suppose that an integer a that is to  be incremented by is located in file b and file b resides on magnetic disk  the increment operation proceeds by first issuing an i o operation to copy the  disk block on which a resides to main memory this operation is followed by  copying a to the cache and to an internal register thus the copy of a appears  in several places on the magnetic disk in main memory in the cache and in an  internal register see figure  once the increment takes place in the internal  register the value of a differs in the various storage systems the value of a  becomes the same only after the new value of a is written from the internal  register back to the magnetic disk  in a computing environment where only one process executes at a tim e  this arrangement poses no difficulties since an access to integer a will always  be to the copy at the highest level of the hierarchy  for example in unix the peculiarities of i o  devices are hidden from the bulk of the operating system itself by the i  subsystem the i o subsystem consists of several components  a memory management component that includes buffering caching and  spooling  a general device driver interface  drivers for specific hardware devices  only the device driver knows the peculiarities of the specific device to which  it is assigned  we discussed in section how interrupt handlers and device drivers are  used in the construction of efficient i o subsystems in chapter we discuss  how the i o subsystem interfaces to the other system components manages  devices transfers data and detects i completion  if a computer system has multiple users and allows the concurrent execution  of multiple processes then access to data must be regulated for that purpose  mechanisms ensure that files memory segments cpu and other resources can  be operated on by only those processes that have gained proper authoriza\\xad tion from the operating system for example memory addressing hardware  ensures that a process can execute only within its own address space the  timer ensures that no process can gain control of the cpu without eventually  relinquishing control device control registers are not accessible to users so  the integrity of the various peripheral devices is protected  protection then is any mechanism for controlling the access of processes  or users to the resourcesdefined by a computer system this mechanism rnist  provide means to specify the confrols to be imposed and means to enforce the  controls  protection can improve reliability by detecting latent errors at the interfaces  between component subsystems early detection of interface errors can often  prevent contamination of a healthy subsystem by another subsystem that is   chapter   malfunctioning furthermore an unprotected resource cannot defend against  use or n isuse by an unauthorized or incompetent user a protection oriented  system provides a means to distinguish between authorized and unauthorized  usage as we discuss in chapter  consider a user whose authentication information   her means of identifying herself to the system is stolen her data could be  copied or deleted even though file and memory protection are working it is  the job of to defend a system from external and internal attacks such  attacks spread across a huge range and include viruses and worms denial of\\xad service attacks which use all of a system s resources and so keep legitimate  users out of the system identity theft and theft of service unauthorized use  of a system prevention of some of these attacks is considered an operating\\xad system function on some systems while other systems leave the prevention to  policy or additional software due to the alarming rise in security incidents  operating system security features represent a fast growing area of research  and implementation security is discussed in chapter  protection and security require the system to be able to distinguish among  all its users most maintain a list of user names and these numerical ids are unique one per user when a user  logs in system the authentication stage determines the appropriate user  id for the user that user id is associated with all of the user s processes and  threads when an id needs to be user readable it is translated back to the user  name via the user name list  in some circumstances we wish to distinguish among sets of users rather  than individual users for example the owner of a file on a unix system may be  allowed to issue all operations on that file whereas a selected set of users may  only be allowed to read the file to accomplish this we need to define a group  name and the set of users belonging to that group group functionality can  be implemented as a system wide list of group names and ic entifiers  a user can be in one or more groups depending on operating system design  decisions the user s group ids are also included in every associated process  and thread  operatmg systems provide various methods to allow  privilege escalation on unix for example the setuid attribute on a program  causes that program to run with the user id of the owner of the file rather than  the current user s id the process runs with this until it turns off  the extra privileges or terminates  a distributed system is a collection of physically separate possibly heteroge\\xad neous computer systems that are networked to provide the users with access  to the various resources that the system maintains access to a shared resource    increases computation speed functionality data availability and reliability  some operating systems generalize network access as a form of file access with  the details of networking contained in the network interface s device driver  others make users specifically invoke network functions generally systems  contain a mix of the two modes for example ftp and nfs the protocols  that create a distributed system can greatly affect that system s utility and  popularity  a in the simplest terms is a communication path between  two or more systems distributed systems depend on networking for their  functionality networks vary by the protocols used the distances between  nodes and the transport media tcp ip is the most common network protocol  although atm and other protocols are in widespread use likewise operating\\xad system support of protocols varies most operating systems support tcp ip  including the windows and unix operating systems some systems support  proprietary protocols to suit their needs to an operating system a network  protocol simply needs an interface device a network adapter for example\\xad with a device driver to manage it as well as software to handle data these  concepts are discussed throughout this book  networks are characterized based on the distances between their nodes  a computers within a room a floor  or a building a n usually links buildings cities  or countries a global company may have a wan to comect its offices  worldwide these networks may run one protocol or several protocols the  continuing advent of new technologies brings about new forms of networks  bluetooth and devices use wireless technology to commt micate  over a distance of several feet in essence creating a such  as might be found in a home  the media to carry networks are equally varied they include copper wires  fiber strands and wireless transmissions between satellites microwave dishes  and radios when computing devices are connected to cellular phones they  create a network even very short range infrared communication can be used  for networking at a rudimentary level whenever computers communicate  they use or create a network these networks also vary in their performance  and reliability  some operating systems have taken the concept of networks and dis\\xad tributed systems further than the notion of providing network connectivity a  is an operating system that provides features such  as file sharing across the network and that includes a communication scheme  that allows different processes on different computers to exchange messages  a computer rmming a network operating system acts autonomously from all  other computers on the network although it is aware of the network and is  able to communicate with other networked computers a distributed operat\\xad ing system provides a less autonomous envirorunent  the discussion thus far has focused on the general purpose computer systems  that we are all familiar with there are however other classes of computer  systems whose functions are more limited and whose objective is to deal with  limited computation domains   real time embedded systems  embedded computers are the most prevalent form of computers in existence  these devices are found everywhere from car engines and manufacturing  robots to dvds and microwave ovens they tend to have very specific tasks  the systencs they run on are usually primitive and so the operating systems  provide limited features usually they have little or no user interface preferring  to spend their time monitoring and managing hardware devices such as  automobile engines and robotic arms  these embedded systems vary considerably some are general purpose  computers running standard operating systems such as unix with  special purpose applications to implement the functionality others are  hardware devices with a special purpose embedded operating system  providing just the functionality desired yet others are hardware devices  with application specific integrated circuits that perform their tasks  without an operating system  the use of embedded systems continues to expand the power of these  devices both as standalone units and as elements of networks and the web  is sure to increase as well even now entire houses can be computerized so  that a central computer either a general purpose computer or an embedded  system can control heating and lighting alarm systems and even coffee  makers web access can enable a home owner to tell the house to heat up  before she arrives home someday the refrigerator may call the grocery store  when it notices the milk is gone  embedded systems almost always run a  real time system is used when rigid time requirements been placed on  the operation of a processor or the flow of data thus it is often used as a  control device in a dedicated application sensors bring data to the computer  the computer must analyze the data and possibly adjust controls to modify  the sensor inputs systems that control scientific experiments medical imaging  systems industrial control systems and certain display systems are real\\xad time systems some automobile engine fuel injection systems home appliance  controllers and weapon systems are also real time systems  a real time system has well defined fixed time constraints processing  must be done within the defined constraints or the system will fail for instance  it would not do for a robot arm to be instructed to halt after it had smashed  into the car it was building a real time system functions correctly only if it  returns the correct result within its time constraints contrast this system with  a time sharing system where it is desirable but not mandatory to respond  quickly or a batch system which may have no time constraints at all  in chapter we cover real time embedded systems in great detail in  chapter we consider the scheduling facility needed to implement real time  functionality in an operating system in chapter we describe the design    of memory management for real time computing finally in chapter we  describe the real time components of the windows xp operating system   multimedia systems  most operating systems are designed to handle conventional data such as  text files progran ls word processing documents and spreadsheets however  a recent trend in technology is the incorporation of multimedia data into  computer systems multimedia data consist of audio and video files as well as  conventional files these data differ from conventional data in that multimedia  data such as frames of video must be delivered streamed according to  certain time restrictions for example frames per second  multimedia describes a wide range of applications in popular use today  these include audio files such as mp dvd movies video conferencing and  short video clips of movie previews or news stories downloaded over the  internet multimedia applications may also include live webcasts broadcasting  over the world wide web of speeches or sporting events and even live  webcams that allow a viewer in manhattan to observe customers at a cafe  in paris multimedia applications need not be either audio or video rather a  multimedia application often includes a combination of both for example a  movie may consist of separate audio and video tracks nor must multimedia  applications be delivered only to desktop personal computers increasingly  they are being directed toward smaller devices including pdas and cellular  telephones for example a stock trader may have stock quotes delivered  wirelessly and in real time to his pda  in chapter we explore the demands of multimedia applications  describe how multimedia data differ from conventional data and explain how  the nature of these data affects the design of operating systems that support  the requirements of multimedia systems   handheld systems  include personal digital assistants pdas such as palm  and pocket pes and cellular telephones many of which use special purpose  embedded operating systems developers of handheld systems and applica\\xad tions face many challenges most of which are due to the limited size of such  devices for example a pda is typically about inches in height and inches  in width and it weighs less than one half pound because of their size most  handheld devices have small amounts of memory slow processors and small  display screens we take a look now at each of these limitations  the amount of physical memory in a handheld depends on the device but  typically it is somewhere between mb and gb contrast this with a typical  pc or workstation which may have several gigabytes of memory as a result  the operating system and applications must manage memory efficiently this  includes returning all allocated memory to the memory manager when the  memory is not being used in chapter we explore virtual memory which  allows developers to write programs that behave as if the system has more  memory than is physically available currently not many handheld devices  use virtual memory techniques so program developers must work within the  confines of limited physical memory   chapter   a second issue of concern to developers of handheld devices is the speed  of the processor used in the devices processors for most handheld devices  run at a fraction of the speed of a processor in a pc faster processors require  more power to include a faster processor in a handheld device would require  a larger battery which would take up more space and would have to be  replaced or recharged more frequently most handheld devices use smaller  slower processors that consume less power therefore the operating system  and applications must be designed not to tax the processor  the last issue confronting program designers for handheld devices is l  a lack of physical space limits input methods to small keyboards handwriting  recognition or small screen based keyboards the small display screens limit  output options whereas a monitor for a home computer may measure up to   inches the display for a handheld device is often no more than inches  square familiar tasks such as reading e mail and browsing web pages must  be condensed into smaller displays one approach for displaying the content  in web pages is where only a small subset of a web page is  delivered and displayed on the handheld device  some handheld devices use wireless technology such as bluetooth or   allowing remote access to e mail and web browsing cellular telephones  with connectivity to the internet fall into this category however for pdas that  do not provide wireless access downloading data typically requires the user  first to download the data to a pc or workstation and then download the data  to the pda some pdas allow data to be directly copied from one device to  another using an infrared link  generally the limitations in the functionality of pdas are balanced by  their convenience and portability their use continues to expand as network  comections become more available and other options such as digital cameras  and mp players expand their utility  so far we have provided an overview of computer system organization and  major operating system components we conclude with a brief overview of  how these are used in a variety of computing environments   traditional computing  as computing matures the lines separating many of the traditional computing  environments are blurring consider the typical office environment just a  few years ago this environment consisted of pcs connected to a network  with servers providing file and print services remote access was awkward  and portability was achieved by use of laptop computers terminals attached  to mainframes were prevalent at many companies as well with even fewer  remote access and portability options  the current trend is toward providing more ways to access these computing  environments web technologies are stretching the boundaries of traditional  computing companies establish which provide web accessibility  to their internal servers ccxepuas are essentially terminals that  understand web based computing handheld computers can synchronize with    pcs to allow very portable use of conpany information handheld pdas can  also connect to to use the company s web portal as well as  the myriad other web resources  at home most users had a single computer with a slow modem connection  to the office the internet or both today network connection speeds once  available only at great cost are relatively inexpensive giving home users more  access to more data these fast data connections are allowing home computers  to serve up web pages and to run networks that include printers client pcs  and servers some homes even have to protect their networks from  security breaches those firewalls cost thousands of dollars a few years ago  and did not even exist a decade ago  in the latter half of the previous century computing resources were scarce   before that they were nonexistent for a period of time systems were either  batch or interactive batch systems processed jobs in bulk with predetermined  input from files or other sources of data interactive systems waited for  input from users to optimize the use of the computing resources multiple  users shared time on these systems time sharing systems used a timer and  scheduling algorithms to rapidly cycle processes through the cpu giving each  user a share of the resources  today traditional time sharing systems are uncommon the same schedul\\xad ing technique is still in use on workstations and servers but frequently the  processes are all owned by the same user or a single user and the operating  system user processes and system processes that provide services to the user  are managed so that each frequently gets a slice of computer time consider  the windows created while a user is working on a pc for example and the fact  that they may be performing different tasks at the same time   client server computing  as pcs have become more powerful and cheaper designers have shifted  away from centralized system architecture terminals connected to centralized  systems are now being supplanted by pcs correspondingly user interface  functionality once handled directly by centralized systems is increasingly being  handled by pcs as a result many of today s systems act as  to satisfy requests generated by this form of specialized  distributed system called a system has the general structure  depicted in figure  server systems can be broadly categorized as compute servers and file  servers  figure general structure of a client server system   chapter  the provides an interface to which a client can  send a request to perform an action for example read data in response  the server executes the action and sends back results to the client a server  running a database that responds to client requests for data is an example  of such a system  the provides a file system interface where clients can  create update read and delete files an example of such a system is a web  server that delivers files to clients running web browsers   peer to peer computing  another structure for a distributed system is the peer to peer pp system  model in this model clients and servers are not distinguished from one  another instead all nodes within the system are considered peers and each  ncay act as either a client or a server depending on whether it is requesting or  providing a service peer to peer systems offer an advantage over traditional  client server systems in a client server system the server is a bottleneck but  in a peer to peer system services can be provided by several nodes distributed  throughout the network  to participate in a peer to peer system a node must first join the network  of peers once a node has joined the network it can begin providing services  to and requesting services from other nodes in the network determining  what services are available is accomplished in one of two general ways  when a node joins a network it registers its service with a centralized  lookup service on the network any node desiring a specific service first  contacts this centralized lookup service to determine which node provides  the service the remainder of the communication takes place between the  client and the service provider  a peer acting as a client must first discover what node provides a desired  service by broadcasting a request for the service to all other nodes in the  network the node or nodes providing that service responds to the peer  making the request to support this approach a discovery protocol must be  provided that allows peers to discover services provided by other peers in  the network  peer to peer networks gained widespread popularity in the late s with  several file sharing services such as napster and gnutella that enable peers  to exchange files with one another the napster system uses an approach  similar to the first type described above a centralized server maintains an  index of all files stored on peer nodes in the napster network and the actual  exchanging of files takes place between the peer nodes the gnutella system  uses a technique similar to the second type a client broadcasts file requests  to other nodes in the system and nodes that can service the request respond  directly to the client the future of exchanging files remains uncertain because  many of the files are copyrighted music for example and there are laws  governing the distribution of copyrighted material in any case though peer\\xad to peer technology undoubtedly will play a role in the future of many services  such as searching file exchange and e mail      web based computing  the web has become ubiquitous leading to more access by a wider variety of  devices than was dreamt of a few years ago pcs are still the most prevalent  access devices with workstations handheld pdas and even cell phones also  providing access  web computing has increased the emphasis on networking devices that  were not previously networked now include wired or wireless access devices  that were networked now have faster network connectivity provided by either  improved networking technology optimized network implementation code  or both  the implementation of web based computing has given rise to new  categories of devices such as which distribute network  connections an ong a pool of similar servers operating systems like windows   which acted as web clients have evolved into linux and windows xp which  can act as web servers as well as clients generally the web has increased the  complexity of devices because their users require them to be web enabled  the study of operating systems as noted earlier is made easier by the  availability of a vast number of open source releases  are those made available in source code format rather than as  compiled binary code linux is the most famous open source operating system  while microsoft windows is a well known example of the opposite dosed  approach starting with the source code allows the programmer to  produce binary code that can be executed on a system doing the opposite\\xad the source code from the binaries is quite a lot of work  and useful items such as comments are never recovered learning operating  systems by examining the actual source code rather than reading summaries of  that code can be extremely useful with the source code in hand a student can  modify the operating system and then compile and nm the code to try out those  changes which is another excellent learning tool this text indudes projects  that involve modifying operating system source code while also describing  algorithms at a high level to be sure all important operating system topics are  covered throughout the text we provide pointers to examples of open source  code for deeper study  there are many benefits to open source operating systems including a  commtmity of interested and usually unpaid programmers who contribute  to the code by helping to debug it analyze it provide support and suggest  changes arguably open source code is more secure than closed source code  because many more eyes are viewing the code certainly open source code has  bugs but open source advocates argue that bugs tend to be found and fixed  faster owing to the number of people using and viewing the code companies  that earn revenue from selling their programs tend to be hesitant to open source  their code but red hat suse sun and a myriad of other companies are doing  just that and showing that commercial companies benefit rather than suffer  when they open source their code revenue can be generated through support  contracts and the sale of hardware on which the software runs for example   chapter   history  in the early days of modern computing that is the s a great deal of  software was available in open source format the original hackers computer  enthusiasts at mit s tech model railroad club left their programs in drawers  for others to work on homebrew user groups exchanged code during their  meetings later company specific user groups such as digital equipment  corporation s dec accepted contributions of source code programs collected  them onto tapes and distributed the tapes to interested ncembers  computer and software companies eventually sought to limit the use  of their software to authorized computers and paying customers releasing  only the binary files compiled from the source code rather than the source  code itself helped them to achieve this goal as well as protecting their code  and their ideas from their competitors another issue involved copyrighted  material operating systems and other programs can limit the ability to play  back movies and music or display electronic books to authorized computers  such or digital would not be  effective if the source code that implemented these limits were published  laws in many countries including the u s digital millennium copyright  act dmca make it illegal to reverse engineer drm code or otherwise try to  circumvent copy protection  to counter the move to limit software use and redistribution richard  stallman in started the gnu project to create a free open source unix\\xad compatible operating system in he published the gnu manifesto which  argues that all software should be free and open sourced he also formed  the with the goal of encouraging the free  exchange of software source code and the free use of that software rather than  copyright its software the fsf copylefts the software to encourage sharing  and improvement the gercera codifies copylefting  and is a common license under which free software is released ftmdamentally  gpl requires that the source code be distributed with any binaries and that any  changes made to the source code be released under the same gpl license   linux  as an example of an open source operating system consider  the gnu project produced many unix compatible tools including compilers  editors and utilities but never released a kernel in a student in  finland linus torvalds released a rudimentary unix like kernel using the  gnu compilers and tools and invited contributions worldwide the advent of  the internet meant that anyone interested could download the source code  modify it and submit changes to torvalds releasing updates once a week  allowed this so called linux operating system to grow rapidly enhanced by  several thousand programmers  the gnu linux operating system has spawned hundreds of  unique or custom builds of the system major distributions  include redhat suse fedora debian slackware and ubuntu distributions  vary in function utility installed applications hardware support user inter\\xad face and purpose for example redhat enterprise limx is geared to large  commercial use pclinuxos is a jvc cd an operating system that can be  booted and run from a cd rom without being installed on a system s hard    disk one variant of pclinuxos pclinuxos supergamer dvd is a  that includes graphics drivers and games a gamer can run it on any compatible  system simply by booting from the dvd when the gamer is finished a reboot  of the system resets it to its installed operating system  access to the linux source code varies by release here we consider  ubuntu linux ubuntu is a popular linux distribution that comes in a variety  of types including those tuned for desktops servers and students its founder  pays for the printing and mailing of dvds containing the binary and source  code which helps to make it popular the following steps outline a way  to explore the ubuntu kernel source code on systems that support

unix  has a longer and more complicated history than linux it started in   as a derivative of at t s unix releases from the university of california  at berkeley ucb came in source and binary form but they were not open\\xad source because a license from at t was required bsd unix s development was  slowed by a lawsuit by at t but eventually a fully functional open source  version bsd lite was

added more and more to  that open source code base unfortunately not all of solaris is open sourced  because some of the code is still owned by at t and other companies however  solaris can be

thousands of open source projects including operating systems sites like  http i freshmeat net and http i i distrowatch com provide portals to  many of these projects open source projects enable students to use source  code as a learning tool they can modify programs and test them help find  and fix bugs and otherwise explore mature full featured operating systems  compilers tools user interfaces and other types of programs the availability  of source code for historic projects such as multics can help students to  understand those projects and to build knowledge that will help in the  implementation of new projects  gnu ilinux bsd unix and solaris are all open source operating sys\\xad tems but each has its own goals utility licensing and purpose sometimes  licenses are not mutually exclusive and cross pollination occurs allowing  rapid improvements in operating system projects for example several major  components of solaris have been ported to bsd unix the advantages of free  software and open sourcing are likely to increase the number and quality of  open source projects leading to an increase in the number of individuals and  companies that use these projects  an operating system is software that manages the cornputer hardware as well  as providing an environment for application programs to run perhaps the    most visible aspect of an operating system is the interface to the computer  system it provides to the human user  for a computer to do its job of executing programs the program s must be  in main memory main memory is the only large storage area that the processor  can access directly it is an array of words or bytes ranging in size from millions  to billions each word in memory has its own address the main mem ory is  usually a volatile storage device that loses its contents when power is turned  off or lost most computer systems provide secondary storage as an extension  of main memory secondary storage provides a form of nonvolatile storage that  is capable of holding large quantities of data permanently the most common  secondary storage device is a magnetic disk which provides storage of both  programs and data  the wide variety of storage systems in a computer system can be organized  in a hierarchy according to speed and cost the higher levels are expensive  but they are fast as we move down the hierarchy the cost per bit generally  decreases whereas the access time generally increases  there are several different strategies for designing a computer system  uniprocessor systems have only a single processor while multiprocessor  systems contain two or more processors that share physical memory and  peripheral devices the most common multiprocessor design is symmetric  multiprocessing or smp where all processors are considered peers and run  independently of one another clustered systems are a specialized form of  multiprocessor systems and consist of multiple computer systems connected  by a local area network  to best utilize the cpu modern operating systems employ multiprogram\\xad ming which allows several jobs to be in memory at the same time thus ensuring  that the cpu always has a job to execute time sharing systems are an exten\\xad sion of multiprogramming wherein cpu scheduling algorithms rapidly switch  between jobs thus providing the illusion that each job is nmning concurrently  the operating system must ensure correct operation of the computer  system to prevent user programs from interfering with the proper operation of  the system the hardware has two modes user mode and kernel mode various  instructions such as i instructions and halt instructions are privileged and  can be executed only in kernel mode the memory in which the operating  system resides must also be protected from modification by the user a tin er  prevents infinite loops these facilities dual mode privileged instructions  memory protection and timer interrupt are basic building blocks used by  operating systems to achieve correct operation  a process or job is the fundamental unit of work in an operating system  process management includes creating and deleting processes and providing  mechanisms for processes to communicate and synchronize with each other  an operating system manages memory by keeping track of what parts of  memory are being used and by whom the operating system is also responsible  for dynamically allocating and freeing memory space storage space is also  managed by the operating system this includes providing file systems for  representing files and directories and managing space on mass storage devices  operating systems must also be concerned with protecting and securing  the operating system and users protection measures are mechanisms that  control the access of processes or users to the resources made available by the   chapter  computer system security measures are responsible for defending a computer  system from external or internal attacks  distributed systems allow users to share resources on geographically  dispersed hosts connected via a computer network services may be provided  through either the client server model or the peer to peer ndel in a clustered  system multiple machines can perform computations on data residing on  shared storage and computing can continue even when some subset of cluster  members fails  lans and wans are the two basic types of networks lans enable  processors distributed over a small geographical area to communicate whereas  wans allow processors distributed over a larger area to communicate lans  typically are faster than wans  there are several computer systems that serve specific purposes these  include real time operating systems designed for embedded environments  such as consumer devices automobiles and robotics real time operating  systems have well defined fixed time constraints processing must be done  within the defined constraints or the system will fail multimedia systems  involve the delivery of multimedia data and often have special requirements  of displaying or playing audio video or synchronized audio and video  streams  recently the influence of the internet and the world wide web has  encouraged the development of operating systems that include web browsers  and networking and communication software as integral features  the free software movement has created thousands of open source projects  including operating systems because of these projects students are able to use  source code as a learning tool they can modify programs and test them  help find and fix bugs and otherwise explore mature full featured operating  systems compilers tools user interfaces and other types of programs  gnu linux bsd unix and solaris are all open source operating systems  the advantages of free software and open sourcing are likely to increase the  number and quality of open source projects leading to an increase in the  number of individuals and companies that use these projects   an operating system provides the environment within which programs are  executed internally operating systems vary greatly in their makeup since  they are organized along many different lines the design of a new operating  system is a major task it is important that the goals of the system be well  defined before the design begins these goals form the basis for choices among  various algorithms and strategies  we can view an operating system from several vantage points one view  focuses on the services that the system provides another on the interface that  it makes available to users and programmers a third on its components and  their interconnections in this chapter we explore all three aspects of operating  systems showin g the viewpoints of users programmers and operating system  designers we consider what services an operating system provides how  they are provided how they are debugged and what the various method\\xad ologies are for designing such systems finally we describe how operating  systems are created and how a computer starts its operating system  to describe the services an operating system provides to users processes  and other systems  to discuss the various ways of structuring an operating system  to explain how operating systems are installed and customized and how  they boot  an operating system provides an environment for the execution of programs  it provides certain services to programs and to the users of those programs  the specific services provided of course differ from one operating system to  another but we can identify common classes these operating system services  are provided for the convenience of the programmer to n ake the programming     chapter  user and other system programs  hardware  figure i a view of operating system services  task easier figure shows one view of the various operating system services  and how they interrelate  one set of operating system services provides functions that are helpfuj to  the user   user interface almost all operating systems have a  this interface can take several forms another is  a batch in which commands and directives to control those  commands are entered into files and those files are executed most  commonly a is used here the interface  is a window system with a pointing device to direct i choose from  menus and make selections and a keyboard to enter text some systems  provide two or all three of these variations  program execution the system must be able to load a program into  memory and to run that program the program must be able to end its  execution either normally or abnormally indicating error  i o operations a running program may require i which may involve a  file or an i device for specific devices special functions may be desired   such as recording to a cd or dvd drive or blanking a display screen for  efficiency and protection users usually cannot control i devices directly  therefore the operating system must provide a means to do i  file system manipulation the file system is of particular interest obvi\\xad ously programs need to read and write files and directories they also  need to create and delete them by name search for a given file and list file  information finally some programs include permissions management to  allow or deny access to files or directories based on file ownership many  operating systems provide a variety of file systems sometimes to allow  personal choice and sometimes to provide specific features or performance  characteristics    communications there are many circumstances in which one process  needs to exchange information with another process such communication  ncay occur between processes that are executing on the same computer  or between processes that are executing on different computer systems  tied together by a computer network communications may be imple\\xad mented via shared rnenwry or through message passing in which packets of  information are moved between processes by the operating system  error detection the operating system needs to be constantly aware of  possible errors errors may occur in the cpu and memory hardware such  as a memory error or a power failure in i devices such as a parity error  on tape a connection failure on a network or lack of paper in the printer  and in the user program such as an arithmetic overflow an attempt to  access an illegal memory location or a too great use of cpu time for each  type of error the operating system should take the appropriate action to  ensure correct and consistent computing of course there is variation in  how operating systems react to and correct errors debugging facilities can  greatly enhance the user s and programmer s abilities to use the system  efficiently  another set of operating system functions exists not for helping the user  but rather for ensuring the efficient operation of the system itself systems with  multiple users can gain efficiency by sharing the computer resources among  the users  resource allocation when there are i lultiple usersormultiple jobs  rmuung at the sametime resources must be allocated to each of them  many different types of resources are managed by the operating system  some such as cpu cycles main memory and file storage may have special  allocation code whereas others such as i devices may have much more  general request and release code for instance in determining how best to  use the cpu operating systems have cpu scheduling routines that take into  account the speed of the cpu the jobs that must be executed the number of  registers available and other factors there may also be routines to allocate  printers modems usb storage drives and other peripheral devices  accounting  what kindsofcomputer resources usage statistics may be a valuable tool for researchers who wish  to reconfigure the system to improve computing services  protection and security the owners of information stored in a multiuser or  networked computer system may want to control use of that information  when several separate processes execute concurrently it hould not be  possible for one process to interfere with the others or with the operating  system itself protection iiwolves ensuring that all access to systerr  resources s controlled security of the system from outsiders is also  important such security starts with requiring each user to authenticate  himself or herself to the system usually by means of a password to gain  access to system resources it extends to defending external i devices   chapter   including modems and network adapters from invalid access attempts  and to recording all such connections for detection of break ins if a system  is to be protected and secure precautions must be instituted throughout  it a chain is only as strong as its weakest link  we mentioned earlier that there are several ways for users to interface with  the operating system here we discuss two fundamental approaches one  provides a command line interface or that allows users  to directly enter commands to be performed by the operating system the  other allows users to interface with the operating system via a graphical user  interface or gui   command interpreter  some operating systems include the command interpreter in the kernel others  such as windows xp and unix treat the command interpreter as a special  program that is rmming when a job is initiated or when a user first logs on   on interactive systems on systems with multiple command interpreters to  choose from the interpreters are known as shells for example on unix and  linux systems a user may choose among several different shells including  the bourne shell c shell bourne again shell korn shell and others third party  shells and free user written shells are also available most shells provide similar  functionality and a user s choice of which shell to use is generally based on  personal preference figure shows the bourne shell command interpreter  being used on solaris  the main function of the command interpreter is to get and execute the next  user specified command many of the commands given at this level manipulate  files create delete list print copy execute and so on the ms dos and unix  shells operate in this way these commands can be implemented in two general  ways  in one approach the command interpreter itself contains the code to  execute the command for example a command to delete a file may cause  the command interpreter to jump to a section of its code that sets up the  parameters and makes the appropriate system call in this case the number of  comn lands that can be given determines the size of the command interpreter  since each command requires its own implementing code  an alternative approach used by unix among other operating systems   implements most commands through system programs in this case the  command interpreter does not understand the cmnmand in any way it merely  uses the command to identify a file to be loaded into memory and executed  thus the unix command to delete a file  rm file txt  would search for a file called rm load the file into memory and execute it with  the parameter file txt the function associated with the rm command would  be defined completely by the code in the file rm in this way programmers can  add new commands to the system easily by creating new files with the proper  figure the bourne shell command interpreter in solaris i  names the command interpreter program which can be small does not have  to be changed for new commands to be added   graphical user interfaces  a second strategy for interfacing with the operating system is through a user\\xad friendly graphical user interface or cui here rather than entering commands  directly via a command line interface users employ a mouse based window  and nl enu system characterized by a metaphor the user moves the  mouse to position its pointer on images or on the screen the desktop  that represent programs files directories and system functions depending  on the mouse pointer s location clicking a button on the mouse can invoke a  program select a file or directory known as a folder or pull down a menu  that contains commands  graphical user interfaces first appeared due in part to research taking place  in the early s at xerox parc research facility the first cui appeared on  the xerox alto computer in however graphical interfaces became more  widespread with the advent of apple macintosh computers in the s the  user interface for the macintosh operating system mac os has undergone  various changes over the years the most significant being the adoption of  the aqua interface that appeared with mac os x microsoft s first version of  windows version was based on the addition of a cui interface to the  ms dos operating system later versions of windows have made cosmetic  changes in the appearance of the cui along with several enhancements in its  functionality including windows explorer   chapter  traditionally unix systencs have been dominated by command line inter\\xad faces various gul interfaces are available however including the common  desktop environment cde and x windows systems which are common  on commercial versions of unix such as solaris and ibm s aix system in  addition there has been significant development in gui designs from various  projects such as i desktop environment or kde and the gnome  desktop by the gnu project both the kde and gnome desktops run on linux  and various unix systems and are available under open source licenses which  means their source code is readily available for reading and for modification  under specific license terms  the choice of whether to use a command line or gui interface is mostly  one of personal preference as a very general rule many unix users prefer  command line interfaces as they often provide powerful shell interfaces  in contrast most windows users are pleased to use the windows gui  environment and almost never use the ms dos shell interface the various  changes undergone by the macintosh operating systems provide a nice study  in contrast historically mac os has not provided a command line interface  always requiring its users to interface with the operating system using its gui  however with the release of mac os x which is in part implemented using a  unix kernel the operating system now provides both a new aqua interface  and a command line interface figure is a screenshot of the mac os x gui  the user interface can vary from system to system and even from user  to user within a system it typically is substantially removed from the actual  system structure the design of a useful and friendly user interface is therefore  figure the mac os x gui     not a direct function of the operating systenc in this book we concentrate on  the fundamental problems of providing adequate service to user programs  from the point of view of the operating system we do not distinguish between  user programs and systern programs  system calls provide an interface to the services made available by an operating  system these calls are generally available as routines written in c and  c although certain low level tasks for example tasks where hardware  must be accessed directly may need to be written using assembly language  instructions  before we discuss how an operating system makes system calls available  let s first use an example to illustrate how system calls are used writing a  simple program to read data from one file and copy them to another file the  first input that the program will need is the names of the two files the input file  and the output file these names can be specified in many ways depending  on the operating system design one approach is for the program to ask the  user for the names of the two files in an interactive system this approach will  require a sequence of system calls first to write a prompting message on the  screen and then to read from the keyboard the characters that define the two  files on mouse based and icon based systems a menu of file names is usually  displayed in a window the user can then use the mouse to select the source  name and a window can be opened for the destination name to be specified  this sequence requires many i system calls  once the two file names are obtained the program must open the input file  and create the output file each of these operations requires another system call  there are also possible error conditions for each operation when the program  tries to open the input file it may find that there is no file of that name or that  the file is protected against access in these cases the program should print a  message on the console another sequence of system calls and then terminate  abnormally another system call if the input file exists then we must create a  new output file we may find that there is already an output file with the same  name this situation may cause the program to abort a system call or we  may delete the existing file another system call and create a new one another  system call another option in an interactive system is to ask the user via  a sequence of system calls to output the prompting message and to read the  response from the termin al whether to replace the existing file or to abort the  program  now that both files are set up we enter a loop that reads from the input  file a system call and writes to the output file another system call each read  and write must return status information regarding various possible error  conditions on input the program may find that the end of the file has been  reached or that there was a hardware failure in the read such as a parity error  the write operation may encounter various errors depending on the output  device no more disk space printer out of paper and so on  finally after the entire file is copied the program may close both files   another system call write a message to the console or window more  system calls and finally terminate normally the final system call as we   chapter  can see even simple programs may make heavy use of the operating system  frequently systems execute thousands of system calls per second this system\\xad call sequence is shown in figure a  most programmers never see this level of detail however typically appli\\xad catiol developers design program s accordirg to an  specifies a set of functions  application programmer including the parameters that are passed to each  function and the return values the programmer can expect three of the most  common apis available to application programmers are the win api for win\\xad dows systems the posix api for posix based systems which include virtually  all versions of unix linux and mac os x and the java api for designing  programs that run on the java virtual machine note that unless specified   the system call names used throughout this text are generic examples each  operating system has its own name for each system call  behind the scenes the functions that make up an api typically invoke the  actual system calls on behalf of the application programmer for example the  win function createprocess  which unsurprisingly is used to create  a new process actually calls the ntcreateprocess system call in the  windows kernel why would an application programnl er prefer programming  according to an api rather than invoking actual system calls there are several  reasons for doing so one benefit of programming according to an api concerns  program portability an application programmer designing a program using  an api can expect her program to compile and run on any system that supports  the same api although in reality architectural differences often make this  more difficult than it may appear furthermore actual system calls can often  be more detailed and difficult to work with than the api available to an  application programmer regardless there often exists a strong correlation  between a function in the api and its associated system call within the kernel  example system call sequence  acquire input file name  write prompt to screen  accept input  acquire output file name  write prompt to screen  accept input  open the input file  if file doesn t exist abort  create output file  if file exists abort  loop  read from input file  write to output file  until read fails  close output file  write completion message to screen  terminate normally  figure example of how system calls are used    example of standard api  as an example of a standard apt consider the readfile £unction in the  win api a function for reading £rom a file the api for this function  appears in figure    ·  return value    bool readfile c  t  function name handle  lpvoid  dword  lpdword  lpoverlapped file  buffer  bytes to read parameters  bytes read  ovl  figure the api for the readfile function  a description of the parameters passed to readfile is as follows  handle file the file to be read  lpvoid buffer a buffer where the data will be read into and written  from  dword bytestoread the number of bytes to be read into the buffer  lpdword bytesread the number of bytes read during the last read  lpoverlapped ovl indicates if overlapped i is being used  in fact many of the posix and win apis are similar to the native system calls  provided by the unix linux and windows operating systems  the run time support system a set of functions built into libraries included  with a compiler for most programming languages provides a system call  interface that serves as the link to system calls made available by the operating  system the system call interface intercepts function calls in the api and  invokes the necessary system calls within the operating system typically  a number is associated with each system call and the system call interface  maintains a table indexed according to these nun lbers the system call interface  then invokes the intended system call in the operating system kernel and  returns the status of the system call and any return values  the caller need know nothing about how the system call is implemented or  what it does during execution ratheh it need only obey the api and understand  what the operating system will do as a result of the execution of that system  call thus most of the details of the operating system interface are hidden from  the programmer by the api and are managed by the run time support library  the relationship between an api the system call interface and the operating   chapter   user  mode  kernel  mode user application  opeo  j  open  implementation  of open  system call  return  figure the handling of a user application invoking the open system call  system is shown in figure which illustrates how the operating system  handles a user application invoking the open system call  system calls occur in different ways depending onthe coj rlplte rjjlll§e  often more information is required than simply the identity of the desired  system call the exact type and ammmt of information vary according to the  particular operating system and call for example to get input we may need  to specify the file or device to use as the source as well as the address and  length of the memory buffer into which the input should be read of course  the device or file and length may be implicit in the call  three general methods are used to pass parameters to the operating  system the simplest approach is to pass the param eters in registers in some  cases however there may be more parameters than registers in these cases  the parameters are generally stored in a block or table in memory and the  address of the block is passed as a parameter in a register figure  this  is the approach taken by linux and solaris parameters also can be placed or  pushed onto the stack by the program and popped oh the stacl by the operatirl g   yste some operating systens prefer the block or stack method because those  approaches do not limit the number or length of parameters being passed  system calls can be grouped oughly intc six major categories process  control file manipujation device manipulation information maintenance  coinmuiii aioii  lndpr tediol in seci lo ri s l hi i o l gli l ·we discllss  briefly the types of system calls that may be provided by an operating system  most of these system calls support or are supported by concepts and functions  x parameters  for call  load address x  system call   user program  register  operating system  figure passing of parameters as a table  that are discussed in later chapters figure summarizes the types of system  calls normally provided by an operating system   process control  a running program needs to be able to halt its execution either normally end  or abnormally abort if a system call is made to terminate the currently  ruruilg program abnormally or if the program runs into a problem and  causes an error trap a dump of memory is sometimes taken and an error  message generated the dump is written to disk and may be examined by a  system program designed to aid the programmer in finding and  correcting bugs to determine the cause of the problem under either normal  or abnormal circumstances the operating system must transfer control to the  invoking command mterpreter the command interpreter then reads the next  cominand in an interactive system the command interpreter simply continues  with the next command it is assumed that the user will issue an appropriate  command to respond to any error in a gui system a pop up wmdow might  alert the user to the error and ask for guidance in a batch system the command  interpreter usually terminates the entire job and continues with the next job  some systems allow control cards to indicate special recovery actions in case  an error occurs a is a batch system concept it is a command to  manage the execution of a process if the program discovers an error in its input  and wants to terminate abnormally it may also want to define an error level  more severe errors can be indicated by a higher level error parameter it is then  possible to combie normal and abnormal termination by defining a normal  termination as an error at level the command interpreter or a following  program can use this error level to determine the next action automatically  a process or jobexecuting one allows the cmnmand iterpreter to execute a  program as directed by for example a user command the click of a mouse  or a batch command an interesting question is where to return control when  the loaded program terminates this question is related to the problem of   chapter  process control  o end abort  o load execute  o create process terminate process  o get process attributes set process attributes  o wait for time  o wait event signal event  o allocate and free memory  file management  o create file delete file  o open close  o read write reposition  o get file

information maintenance  o get time or date set time or date  o get system data set system data  o get process file or device attributes  o set process file or device attributes  communications  o create delete communication connection  o send receive messages  o transfer status information  o attach or detach remote devices  figure types of system calls  whether the existing program is lost saved or allowed to continue execution  concurrently with the new program  if control returns to the existing program when the new program termi\\xad nates we must save the memory image of the existing program thus we have  effectively created a mechanism for one program to call another program if  both programs continue concurrently we have created a new job or process to    examples of

is a system call specifically for this purpose   create process or submit job  if we create a new job or process or perhaps even a set of jobs or processes  we should be able to control its execution this control requires the ability  to determine and reset the attributes of a job or process including the job s  priority its maximum allowable execution time and so on get process  attributes and set process attributes we may also want to terminate  a job or process that we created terminate process if we find that it is  incorrect or is no longer needed  having created new jobs or processes we may need to wait for them  to finish their execution we may want to wait for a certain amount of time  to pass wait time more probably we will want to wait for a specific event to  occur wait event the jobs or processes should then signal when that event  has occurred signal event quite often two or more processes may share  data to ensure the integrity of the data being shared operating systems often  provide system calls allowing a process to lock shared data thus preventing  another process from accessing the data while it is locked typically such  system calls include acquire lock and release lock system calls of these   chapter  example of standard c library  the standard c library provides a portion of the system call interface for  many versions of unix and linux as an example let s assume a c program  invokes the printf statement the c library intercepts this call and  invokes the necessary system call s in the operating system in this instance  the write system call the c library takes the value returned by write  and passes it back to the user program this is shown in figure  user  mode  kernel  mode i  i include stdio h  int main     printf greetings i  return  standard c library  write   system call i  i    figure standard c library handling of write  types dealilcg with the coordination of concurrent processes are discussed in  great detail in chapter  there are so many facets of and variations in process and job control that  we next use two examples one involving a single tasking system and the  other a multitasking system to clarify these concepts the ms dos operating  system is an example of a single tasking system it has a command interpreter  that is invoked when the computer is started figure a because ms dos  is single tasking it uses a sincple method to run a program and does not create  a new process it loads the program into memory writing over most of itself to  give the program as much memory as possible figure b next it sets the  instruction pointer to the first instruction of the program the program then  runs and either an error causes a trap or the program executes a system call  to terminate in either case the error code is saved in the system memory for  later use following this action the small portion of the command interpreter  that was not overwritten resumes execution its first task is to reload the rest  free memory  command  interpreter   a  free memory  process  command  interpreter   b  figure ms dos execution a at system startup b running a program  of the command interpreter from disk then the command interpreter makes  the previous error code available to the user or to the next program  when a user logs on to the system the shell otthe user s choice\\xad is run this shell is similar to the ms dos shell in that it accepts commands  and executes programs that the user requests however since freebsd is a  multitasking system the command interpreter may continue running while  another program is executed figure  then the selected program is loaded into  memory via an exec system call and the program is executed depending  on the way the command was issued the shell then either waits for the process  to finish or runs the process in the background in the latter case the shell  immediately requests another command when a process is rmming in the  background it cannot receive input directly fron the keyboard because the  process d  free memory  process c  interpreter  figure freebsd running multiple programs   chapter  shell is using this resource i o is therefore done through files or through a cui  interface meanwhile the user is free to ask the shell to run other programs to  monitor the progress of the running process to change that program s priority  and so on when the process is done it executes an exit system call to  terminate returning to the invoking process a status code of or a nonzero  error code this status or error code is then available to the shell or other  programs processes are discussed in chapter with a program example using  thefork and exec systemcalls   file management  the file system is discussed in more detail in chapters and we can  however identify several common system calls dealing with files  we first need to be able to create and delete files either system call  requires the name of the file and perhaps some of the file s attributes once the  file is created we need to open it and to use it we may also read write or  reposition rewinding or skipping to the end of the file for example finally  we need to close the file indicating that we are no longer using it  we may need these same sets of operations for directories if we have a  directory structure for organizing files in the file system in addition for either  files or directories we need to be able to determine the values of various  attributes and perhaps to reset them if necessary file attributes include the  file name file type protection codes accounting information and so on at  least two system calls get file attribute and set file attribute are  required for this function some operating systems provide many more calls  such as calls for file move and copy others might provide an api that performs  those operations using code and other system calls and others might just  provide system programs to perform those tasks if the system programs are  callable by other programs then each can be considered an api by other system  programs   device management  a process may need several resources to execute main memory disk drives  access to files and so on if the resources are available they can be granted  and control can be returned to the user process otherwise the process will  have to wait until sufficient resources are available  the various resources controlled by the operating system can be thought  of as devices some of these devices are physical devices for example disk  drives while others can be thought of as abstract or virtual devices for  example files a system with multiple users may require us to first request  the device to ensure exclusive use of it after we are finished with the device  we release it these functions are similar to the open and close system  calls for files other operating systems allow llnmanaged access to devices  the hazard then is the potential for device contention and perhaps deadlock  which is described in chapter  once the device has been requested and allocated to us we can read  write and possibly reposition the device just as we can with files in fact  the similarity between i devices and files is so great that many operating  systems including unix merge the two into a combined file device structure  in this case a set of system calls is used on both files and devices sometimes    l devices are identified by special file names directory placement or file  attributes  the user interface can also ncake files and devices appear to be similar even  though the underlying system calls are dissimilar this is another example of  the many design decisions that go into building an operating system and user  interface   information maintenance  many system calls exist simply for the purpose of transferring information  between the user program and the operating system for example most  systems have a system call to return the current time and date other system  calls may return information about the system such as the number of current  users the version number of the operating system the amount of free memory  or disk space and so on  another set of system calls is helpful in debugging a program many  systems provide system calls to dump memory this provision is useful for  debugging a program trace lists each system call as it is executed even  microprocessors provide a cpu mode known as single step in which a trap is  executed by the cpu after every instruction the trap is usually caught by a  debugger  many operating systems provide a time profile of a program to indicate  the amount of time that the program executes at a particular location or set  of locations with sufficiently frequent timer interrupts a statistical  picture of the time spent on various parts of the program can be obtained  in addition the operating system keeps information about all its processes  and system calls are used to access this information generally calls are  also used to reset the process information get process attributes and  set process attributes in section  we discuss what information is  normally kept   communication  messages can be exchanged between the processes either directly  or indirectly through a common mailbox before communication can take  place a connection must be opened the name of the other communicator  must be known be it another process on the same system or a process on  another computer comcected by a communications network each computer  in a network has a host name by which it is commonly known a host also  has a network identifier such as an ip address similarly each process has  a process narne and this name is translated into an identifier by which the  operating systemcanrefertotheprocess the get hostidand get processid  system calls do this translation the identifiers are then passed to the general\\xad purpose open and close calls provided by the file system or to specific  open connection and close connection system calls depending on the  system s model of communication the recipient process usually must give its   chapter   permission for comnmnication to take place with an accept connection call  most processes that will be receiving connections are special purpose daemons  which are systems programs provided for that purpose they execute a wait  for connection call and are awakened when a connection is rna de the source  of the communication known as the client and the receiving daenwn known as  a server then exchange messages by using read message and write message  system calls the close connection call terminates the communication  memory requires that two or more processes agree to remove this restriction  they can then exchange information by reading and writing data in the shared  areas the form of the data is determined by the processes and are not under  the operating system s control the processes are also responsible for ensuring  that they are not writing to the same location sirnultaneously such mechanisms  are discussed in chapter in chapter we look at a variation of the process  scheme threads in which memory is shared by default  both of the models just discussed are common in operating systems  and most systems implement both message passing is useful for exchanging  smaller amounts of data because no conflicts need be avoided it is also easier to  implement than is shared memory for intercomputer communication shared  memory allows maximum speed and convenience of communication since it  can be done at memory transfer speeds when it takes place within a computer  problems exist however in the areas of protection and synchronization  between the processes sharing memory   protection  protection provides a mechanism for controlling access to the resources  provided by a computer system historically protection was a concern only on  multiprogrammed computer systems with several users however with the  advent of networking and the internet all computer systems from servers to  pdas must be concerned with protection  typically system calls providing protection include set permission and  get permission which manipulate the permission settings of resources  such as files and disks the allow user and deny user system calls spec\\xad ify whether particular users can or cannot be allowed access to certain  resources  we cover protection in chapter and the much larger issue of security in  chapter  another aspect of a modern system is the collection of system programs recall  figure which depicted the logical computer hierarchy at the lowest level is  hardware next is the operating system then the system programs and finally  the application programs  some of them are simply user interfaces to system calls others are considerably  more complex they can be divided into these categories  file management these programs create delete copy rename print  dump list and generally ncanipulate files and directories  status information some programs simply ask the system for the date  time amount of available memory or disk space number of users or  similar status information others are more complex providing detailed  performance logging and debugging information typically these pro\\xad grams format and print the output to the terminal or other output devices  or files or display it in a window of the gui some systems also support a  which is used to store and retrieve configuration information  file modification several text editors may be available to create and  modify the content of files stored on disk or other storage devices there  may also be special commands to search contents of files or perform  transformations of the text  programming language support compilers assemblers debuggers and  interpreters for common programming languages such as c c java  visual basic and perl are often provided to the user with the operating  system  program loading and execution once a program is assembled or com\\xad piled it must be loaded into memory to be executed the system may  provide absolute loaders relocatable loaders linkage editors and overlay  loaders debugging systems for either higher level languages or machine  language are needed as well  communications these programs provide the mechanism for creating  virtual comcections among processes users and computer systems they  allow users to send rnessages to one another s screens to browse web  pages to send electronic mail messages to log in remotely or to transfer  files from one machine to another  in addition to systems programs most operating systems are supplied  with programs that are useful in solving common problems or performing  common operations when a user s computer is rumcing the mac os x  operating system the user might see the gui featuring a mouse and windows  interface alternatively or even in one of the windows the user might have  a command line unix shell both use the same set of system calls but the  system calls look different and act in different ways further confusing the  user view consider the user dual booting from mac os x into windows vista  now the same user on the same hardware has two entirely different interfaces  and two sets of applications using the same physical resources on the same   chapter   hardware then a user can be exposed to multiple user interfaces sequentially  or concurrently  in this section we discuss problems we face in designing and implementing an  operating system there are of course no complete solutions to such problems  but there are approaches that have proved successful   design goals  the first problem in designing a system is to define goals and specifications  at the highest level the design of the system will be affected by the choice of  hardware and the type of system batch time shared single user multiuser  distributed real time or general purpose  beyond this highest design level the requirements may be much harder to  specify the requirements can however be divided into two basic groups user  goals and system goals  users desire certain obvious properties in a system the system should be  convenient to use easy to learn and to use reliable safe and fast of course  these specifications are not particularly useful in the system design since there  is no general agreement on how to achieve them  a similar set of requirements can be defined by those people who must  design create maintain and operate the system the system should be easy to  design implement and maintain and it should be flexible reliable error free  and efficient again these requirements are vague and may be interpreted in  various ways  there is in short no unique solution to the problem of defining the  requirements for an operating system the wide range of systems in existence  shows that different requirements can result in a large variety of solutions for  different environments for example the requirements for vxworks a real\\xad time operating system for embedded systems must have been substantially  different from those for mvs a large multiuser multiaccess operating system  for ibm mainframes  specifying and designing an operating system is a highly creative task  although no textbook can tell you how to do it general principles have  been developed in the field of software engineering and we turn now to  a discussion of some of these principles   implementation  once an operating system is designed it must be implemented traditionally  operating systems have been written in assembly language now however  they are most commonly written in higher level languages such as cor c  the first system that was not written in assembly language was probably  the master control program mcp for burroughs computers mcp was written  in a variant of algol multics developed at mit was written mainly in  pl the linux and windows xp operating systems are written mostly in c  although there are some small sections of assembly code for device drivers and  for saving and restoring the state of registers  the advantages of using a higher level language or at least a systems\\xad implementation language for implementing operating systems are the same  as those accrued when the language is used for application programs the  code can be written faster is more compact and is easier to understand and  debug in addition improvements in compiler technology will improve the  generated code for the entire operating system by simple recompilation finally  an operating system is far easier to port to move to some other hardware if  it is written in a higher level language for example ms dos was written in intel   assembly language consequently it runs natively only on the intel x  family of cpus although ms dos runs natively only on intel x emulators  of the x instruction set allow the operating system to run non natively\\xad slower with more resource use on other cpus are programs that  duplicate the functionality of one system with another system the linux   chapter   operating system in contrast is written mostly inc and is available natively on  a number of different cpus including intel x sun sparc and ibmpowerpc  the only possible disadvantages of implementing an operating system in a  higher level language are reduced speed and increased storage requirements  this however is no longer a major issue in today s systems although an  expert assembly language programmer can produce efficient small routines  for large programs a modern compiler can perform complex analysis and apply  sophisticated optimizations that produce excellent code modern processors  have deep pipelining and n ultiple functional units that can handle the details  of complex dependencies much more easily than can the human mind  as is true in other systems major performance improvements in operating  systems are more likely to be the result of better data structures and algorithms  than of excellent assembly language code in addition although operating sys\\xad tems are large only a small amount of the code is critical to high performance  the memory manager and the cpu scheduler are probably the most critical rou\\xad tines after the system is written and is working correctly bottleneck routines  can be identified and can be replaced with assembly language equivalents  a system as large and complex as a modern operating system must be  engineered carefully if it is to function properly and be modified easily a  common approach is to partition the task into small components rather than  have one monolithic system each of these modules should be a well defined  portion of the system with carefully defined inputs outputs and functions  we have already discussed briefly in chapter the common components  of operating systems in this section we discuss how these components are  interconnected and melded into a kernel   simple structure  many commercial operating systen s do not have well defined structures  frequently such systems started as small simple and limited systems and  then grew beyond their original scope ms dos is an example of such a systen  it was originally designed and implemented by a few people who had no  idea that it would become so popular it was written to provide the most  functionality in the least space so it was not divided into modules carefully  figure shows its structure  in ms dos the interfaces and levels of functionality are not wellseparated  for rnstai ce appii caton programs aie able to access the basic i b outiri es  to write directly to the display and disk drives such freedom leaves ms dos  vulnerable to errant or malicio lls programs causing entire system crashes  when user programs fail of course ms dos was also limited by the hardware  of its era because the intel for which it was written provides no dual  mode and no hardware protection the designers of ms dos had no choice but  to leave the base hardware accessible  another example of limited structuring is the original unix operating  systein like ms dcs unix initially was limited· by hard ware ftil cfionali ty ft  consistsoftwo separahlepai fs thei eril el aid the system prograrns ·thekei nel    rom bios device drivers  figure ms dos layer structure  is further separated into a series of interfaces and device drivers which have  been added and expanded over the years as unix has evolved we can view the  traditional unix operating system as being layered as

retain much greater  control over the computer and over the applications that make use of that  computer implementers have more freedom in changing the inner workin gs  of the system and in creating modular operating systems under a top\\xad down approach the overall functionality and features are determined and  are separated into components information hiding is also important because  it leaves programmers free to implement the low level routines as they see fit  provided that the external interface of the routine stays unchanged and that  the routine itself performs the advertised task  a system can be made modular in many ways qne method is the layered  approach in which the operating system is broken iito a l umberoflayers   leverj tieoottom iiiyer layer sthetiarawai e the nig ytesl layern  sfhe  user interface this layering structure is depicted in figure  an operating system layer is an implementation of an abstract object made  up of data and the operations that can manipulate those data a typical  operating system layer say layer m consists of data structures and a set  of routines that can be invoked by higher level layers layer m in turn can  invoke operations on lower level layers  the main advantage of the layered approach is simplicity of construction  and debugging the layers are selected so that each uses functions operations  and services of only lower level layers this approach simplifies debugging  and system verification the first layer can be debugged without any concern  for the rest of the system because by definition it uses only the basic hardware   which is assumed correct to implement its functions once the first layer is  debugged its correct functioning can be assumed while the second layer is  debugged and so on if an error is found during the debugging of a particular  layer the error must be on that layer because the layers below it are already  debugged thus the design and implementation of the system are simplified    each layer is implemented with only those operations provided by lower\\xad level layers a layer does not need to know how these operations are  implemented it needs to know only what these operations do hence each  layer hides the existence of certain data structures operations and hardware  from higher level layers  the major difficulty with the layered approach involves appropriately  defining the various layers because a layer can use only lower level layers  careful planning is necessary for example the device driver for the backing  store disk space used by virtual memory algorithms must be at a lower  level than the memory management routines because memory management  requires the ability to use the backing store  other requirements may not be so obvious the backing store driver would  normally be above the cpu scheduler because the driver may need to wait for  i and the cpu can be rescheduled during this time however on a large  system the cpu scheduler m ay have more information about all the active  processes than can fit in memory therefore this u formation may need to be  swapped u and out of memory requiring the backu g store driver routine to  be below the cpu scheduler  a final problem with layered implementations is that they tend to be less  efficient than other types for instance when a user program executes an i  operation it executes a system call that is trapped to the i layer which calls  the memory management layer which in tum calls the cpu scheduling layer  which is then passed to the hardware at each layer the parameters may be  modified data may need to be passed and so on each layer adds overhead to  the system call the net result is a system call that takes longer than does one  on a nonlayered system  these limitations have caused a small backlash against layering in recent  years fewer layers with more functionality are beu g designed providu g most  of the advantages of modularized code while avoidu g the difficult problems  of layer definition and interaction   microkernels  we have already seen that as unix expanded the kernel became large  and difficult to manage in the mid s researchers at carnegie mellon  university developed an operatu g system called mach that modularized  the kernel using the reslin is a smarrei  kernel there is little consensus regarding which services should remain u the  kernel and which should be implemented in user space typically however  microkernels provide minimal process and memory management in addition  to a communication facility  the main function of the micro kernel is to provide a communication facility  between the client program and the various services that are also rum ing  in user space communication is provided by message passing which was  described in section  for example if the client program wishes to access  a file it must interact with the file server the client program and service never  interact directly ratheh they communicate indirectly by exchanging messages  with the microkemel   chapter  one benefit of the microkernel approach is ease of extending the operating  system all new services are added to user space and consequently do not  require modification of the kernel when the kernel does have to be modified  the changes tend to be fewer because the microkernel is a smaller kernel  the resulting operating system is easier to port from one hardware design  to another the microkernel also provides more security and reliability since  most services are running as user rather than kernel processes if a service  fails the rest of the operating system remains untouched  several contemporary operating systems have used the microkernel  approach tru unix formerly digital unix provides a unix interface to the  user but it is implemented with a mach kernel the mach kernel maps unix  system calls into messages to the appropriate user level services the mac os  x kernel also known as darwin is also based on the mach micro kernel  another example is qnx a real time operating system the qnx nl icro\\xad kernel provides services for message passing and process scheduling it also  handles low level network communication and hardware interrupts all other  services in qnx are provided by standard processes that run outside the kernel  in user mode  unfortunately microkernels can suffer from performance decreases due  to increased system function overhead consider the history of windows nt  the first release had a layered microkernel organization however this version  delivered low performance compared with that of windows windows nt   partially redressed the performance problem by moving layers from user  space to kernel space and integrating them more closely by the time windows  xp was designed its architecture was more monolithic than microkernel   modules  perhaps the best current methodology for operating system design involves  using object oriented programming techniques to create a modular kernel  here the kernel has a set of core components and links in additional services  either during boot time or during run time such a strategy uses dynamically  loadable modules and is common in modern implementations of unix such  as solaris linux and mac os x for example the solaris operating system  structure shown in figure is organized armmd a core kernel with seven  types of loadable kernel modules  scheduling classes  file systems  loadable system calls  executable formats  streams modules  miscellaneous  device and bus drivers  such a design allows the kernel to provide core services yet also allows  certain features to be implemented dynamically for example device and    file systems  figure solaris loadable modules loadable  system calls  bus drivers for specific hardware can be added to the kernel and support  for different file systems can be added as loadable modules the overall  result resembles a layered system in that each kernel section has defined  protected interfaces but it is more flexible than a layered system in that any  module can call any other module furthermore the approach is like the  microkernel approach in that the primary module has only core functions  and knowledge of how to load and communicate with other modules but it  is more efficient because modules do not need to invoke message passing in  order to communicate  the apple mac os x operating system uses a hybrid structure it is a layered  system in which one layer consists of the mach microkernel the structure of  mac os x appears in figure the top layers include application environ\\xad ments and a set of services providing a graphical interface to applications  below these layers is the kernel environment which consists primarily of the  mach microkernel and the bsd kernel mach provides memory management  support for remote procedure calls rpcs and interprocess communication   ipc facilities including message passing and thread scheduling the bsd  component provides a bsd command line interface support for networking  and file systems and an implementation of posix apis including pthreads  kernel  environment application environments  and common services  figure the mac os x structure   chapter   in addition to mach and bsd the kernel environment provides an i kit for  development of device drivers and dynamically loadable modules which mac  os x refers to as kernel extensions as shown in the figure applications and  comn n services can make use of either the mach or bsd facilities directly  the layered approach described in section is taken to its logical conclusion  in the concept of a the fundamental idea behind a virtual  machine is to abstract the hardware of a si gle computer the cpu memory  disk drives network interface cards and so forth into several different  execution environments thereby creating the illusion that each separate  execution environment is run ning its own private computer  by using cpu scheduling chapter and virtual memory techniques   chapter an operating system can create the illusion that a process  has its own processor with its own virtual memory the virtual machine  provides an interface that is identical to the underlying bare hardware each  process is provided with a virtual copy of the underlying computer   figure  usually the guest process is in fact an operating system and  that is how a single physical machine can run multiple operating systems  concurrently each in its own virtual machine   history  virtual machines first appeared commercially on ibm mainframes via the vm  operating system in vm has evolved and is still available and many of  processes  programming   interface      kernel   a processes  processes  processes  kernel kernel kernel  vm vm vm  virtual machine  implementation   b  figure system models a nonvirtual machine b virtual machine    the original concepts are found in other systems making this facility worth  exploring  ibm vm divided a mainframe into nmltiple virtual machines each  numing its own operating system a ncajor difficulty with the vm virtual\\xad machine approach involved disk systems suppose that the physical machine  had three disk drives but wanted to support seven virtual machines clearly it  could not allocate a disk drive to each virtual machine because the virtual\\xad machine software itself needed substantial disk space to provide virtual  memory and spooling the solution was to provide virtual disks termed  minidislcs in ibm s vm operating system that are identical in all respects except  size the system implemented each minidisk by allocating as many tracks on  the physical disks as the minidisk needed  once these virtual machines were created users could run any of the  operating systems or software packages that were available on the underlying  machine for the ibm vm system a user normally ran cms a single user  interactive operating system   benefits  there are several reasons for creating a virtual machine most of them are  fundarnentally related to being able to share the same hardware yet run  several different execution environments that is different operating systems  concurrently  one important advantage is that the host system is protected from the  virtual machines just as the virtual machines are protected from each other a  virus inside a guest operating system might damage that operating system but  is unlikely to affect the host or the other guests because each virtual machine  is completely isolated from all other virtual machines there are no protection  problems at the same time however there is no direct sharing of resources  two approaches to provide sharing have been implemented first it is possible  to share a file system volume and thus to share files second it is possible to  define a network of virtual machines each of which can send information over  the virtual communications network the network is modeled after physical  communication networks but is implemented in software  a virtual machine system is a perfect vehicle for operating systems  research and development normally changing an operating system is a diffi\\xad cult task operating systems are large and complex programs and it is difficult  to be sure that a change in one part will not cause obscure bugs to appear  in some other part the power of the operating system makes changing it  particularly dangerous because the operating system executes in kernel mode  a wrong change in a pointer could cause an error that would destroy the entire  file system thus it is necessary to test all changes to the operating system  carefully  the operating system however runs on and controls the entire machine  therefore tlle current system must be stopped and taken out of use while  changes are made and tested this period is comnconly called system\\xad development time since it makes the system unavailable to users system\\xad development time is often scheduled late at night or on weekends when system  load is low   chapter  a virtual machine system can eliminate much of this problem system  programmers are given their own virtual machine and system development is  done on the virtual machine instead of on a physical machine normal system  operation seldom needs to be disrupted for system development  another advantage of virtual machines for developers is that multiple  operating systems can be running on the developer s workstation concur\\xad rently this virtualized workstation allows for rapid porting and testing of  programs in varying enviromnents sin lilarly quality assurance engineers can  test their applications in multiple environments without buying powering  and maintaining a computer for each environment  a major advantage of virtual machines in production data center use is  system which involves taking two or more separate systems  and running them in virtual machines on one system such physical to virtual  conversions result in resource optimization as many lightly used systems can  be combined to create one more heavily used system  if the use of virtual machines continues to spread application deployment  will evolve accordingly if a system can easily add remove and move a  virtual machine then why install applications on that system directly instead  application developers would pre install the application on a tuned and  customized operating system in a virhal machine that virtual environment  would be the release mechanism for the application this method would be  an improvement for application developers application management would  become easier less tuning would required and technical support of the  application would be more straightforward system administrators would  find the environment easier to manage as well installation would be simple  and redeploying the application to another system would be much easier  than the usual steps of uninstalling and reinstalling for widespread adoption  of this methodology to occur though the format of virtual machines must  be standardized so that any virtual machine will run on any virtualization  platform the open virtual machine format is an attempt to do just that  and it could succeed in unifying virtual machine formats   simulation  system virtualization as discussed so far is just one of many system emulation  methodologies virtualization is the most common because it makes guest  operating systems and applications believe they are running on native  hardware because only the system s resources need to be virtualized these  guests run at almost full speed  another methodology is in which the host system has one  system architecture and the guest system was compiled for a different archi\\xad tecture for example suppose a company has replaced its outdated computer  system with a new system but would like to continue to run certain important  programs that were compiled for the old system the programs could be run  in an enulator that translates each of the outdated system s instructions into  the native instruction set of the new system emulation can increase the life of  programs and allow us to explore old architectures without having an actual  old machine but its major challenge is performance instruction set emulation  can run an order of magnitude slower than native instructions thus unless  the new machine is ten times faster than the old the program running on    the new machine will run slower than it did on its native hardware another  challenge is that it is difficult to create a correct emulator because in essence  this involves writing an entire cpu in software   para virtualization  is another vanatn on this theme rather than try to  trick a guest operating system into believing it has a system to itself para\\xad virtualization presents the guest with a system that is similar but not identical  to the guest s preferred system the guest must be modified to run on the  paravirtualized hardware the gain for this extra work is more efficient use of  resources and a smaller virtualization layer  solaris includes or that create a virtual layer between  the operating system and the applications in this system only one kernel is  installed and the hardware is not virtualized rather the operating system  and its devices are virtualized providing processes within a container with  the impression that they are the only processes on the system one or more  containers can be created and each can have its own applications network  stacks network address and ports user accounts and so on cpu resources  can be divided up among the containers and the systemwide processes figure   shows a solaris system with two containers and the standard global  user space  user programs  system programs  cpu resources  memory resources  global zone user programs

platform  device management  figure solaris i with two containers   chapter   implementation  although the virtual machine concept is usefut it is difficult to implement  much work is required to provide an exact duplicate of the underlying machine  remember that the underlying machine typically has two modes user mode  and kernel mode the virtual machine software can run in kernel mode since  it is the operating system the virtual machine itself can execute in only user  mode just as the physical machine has two modes however so must the virtual  machine consequently we must have a virtual user mode and a virtual kernel  mode both of which run in a physical user mode those actions that cause a  transfer from user mode to kernel mode on a real machine such as a system  call or an attempt to execute a privileged instruction must also cause a transfer  from virtual user mode to virtual kernel mode on a virtual machine  such a transfer can be accomplished as follows when a system calt for  example is made by a program running on a virtual machine in virtual user  mode it will cause a transfer to the virtual machine monitor in the real machine  when the virtual machine monitor gains controt it can change the register  contents and program counter for the virtual machine to simulate the effect of  the system call it can then restart the virtual machine noting that it is now in  virtual kernel mode  the major difference of course is time whereas the real i o might have  taken milliseconds the virtual i o might take less time because it is  spooled or more time because it is interpreted in addition the cpu is  being multi programmed among many virtual machines further slowing down  the virtual machines in unpredictable ways in the extreme case it may be  necessary to simulate all instructions to provide a true virtual machine vm  discussed earlier works for ibm machines because normal instructions for the  virtual machines can execute directly on the hardware only the privileged  instructions needed mainly for i must be simulated and hence execute  more slowly  without some level of hardware support virtualization would be impos\\xad sible the more hardware support available within a system the more feature  rich stable and well performing the virtual machines can be all major general\\xad purpose cpus provide some amount of hardware support for virtualization  for example amd virtualization technology is found in several amd proces\\xad sors it defines two new modes of operation host and guest virtual machine  software can enable host mode define the characteristics of each guest virtual  machine and then switch the system to guest mode passing control of the  system to the guest operating system that is running in the virtual machine  in guest mode the virtualized operating system thinks it is rum ing on native  hardware and sees certain devices those included in the host s definition of  the guest if the guest tries to access a virtualized resource then control is  passed to the host to manage that interaction   examples  despite the advantages of virtual machines they received little attention for  a number of years after they were first developed today however virtual  machines are coming into fashion as a means of solving system compatibility  problems in this section we explore two popular contemporary virtual  machines the vmware workstation and the java virtual machine as you    will see these virtual machines can typically run on top of operating systems  of any of the design types discussed earlier thus operating system design  methods simple layers microkernels n wdules and virtual machines are  not mutually exclusive   vmware  most of the virtualization techniques discussed in this section require virtual\\xad ization to be supported by the kernel another method involves writing the  virtualization tool to run in user mode as an application on top of the operating  system virtual machines running within this tool believe they are rum ing on  bare hardware but in fact are running inside a user level application  is a popular commercial application that abstracts  intel x and compatible hardware into isolated virtual machines vmware  workstation runs as an application on a host operating system such as windows  or linux and allows this host system to concurrently run several different guest  operating systems as independent virtual machines  the architecture of such a system is shown in figure in this scenario  linux is running as the host operating system and freebsd windows nt and  windows xp are rum ing as guest operating systems the virtualization layer is  the heart of vmware as it abstracts the physical hardware into isolated virtual  machines running as guest operating systems each virtual machine has its  own virtual cpu memory disk drives network interfaces and so forth  the physical disk the guest owns and manages is really just a file within the  file system of the host operating system to create an identical guest instance  we can simply copy the file copying the file to another location protects the  guest instance against a disaster at the

virtual machine  java is a popular object oriented programming language introduced by sun  microsystems in in addition to a language specification and a large api  library java also provides a specification for a java virtual machine or jvm  java objects are specified with the class construct a java program  consists of one or more classes for each java class the compiler produces  an architecture neutral bytecode output class file that will run on any  implementation of the jvm  the jvm is a specification for an abstract computer it consists of a class  loader and a java interpreter that executes the architecture neutral bytecodes  as diagrammed in figure the class loader loads the compiled class  files from both the java program and the java api for execution by the java  interpreter after a class is loaded the verifier checks that the class file is  valid java bytecode and does not overflow or underflow the stack it also  ensures that the bytecode does not perform pointer arithmetic which could  provide illegal memory access if the class passes verification it is run by the  java interpreter the jvm also automatically manages memory by performing  garbage collection the practice of reclaiming memory from objects no longer  in use and returning it to the system much research focuses on garbage  collection algorithms for increasing the performance of java programs in the  virtual machine  the jvm may be implemented in software on top of a host operating  system such as windows linux or mac os x or as part of a web browser  alternatively the jvm may be implemented in hardware on a chip specifically  designed to nm java programs if the jvm is implemented in software the  java interpreter interprets the bytecode operations one at a time a faster  software technique is to use a just in time jit compiler here the first time a  java method is invoked the bytecodes for the method are turned into native  machine language for the host system these operations are then cached so that  subsequent invocations of a method are performed using the native machine  instructions and the bytecode operations need not be interpreted all over again  a technique that is potentially even faster is to nm the jvm in hardware on a  java program   class files •i class loader   i java i interpreter  t  host system   windows linux etc  figure the java virtual machine    the net framework  the net framework is a collection of technologies including a set of class  libraries and an execution environment that come together to provide a  platform for developing software this platform allows programs to be  written to target the net framework instead of a specific architecture a  program written for the net framework need not worry aboutthe specifics  of the hardware or the operating system on which it will run thus any  architecture implementing net will be able to successfully execute the  program this is because the execution environment abstracts these details  and provides a virtual machine as an intermediary between the executing  program and the underlying architecture  at the core of the net framework is the common language runtime   clr the clr is the implementation of the net virtual machine itprovides  an environment for execution of programs written in any of the languages  targeted at the net framework programs written in languages such as  c pronounced c sharp and vb net are compiled into an intermediate  architecture independent language called microsoft intermediate language   ms il these compiled files called assemblies include ms il instructions  and metadata they have file extensions of either exe or dll upon  execution of a program the clr loads assemblies into what is known as  the application domain as instructions are requested by the executing  program the clr converts the ms il instructions inside the assemblies into  native code that is specific to the underlying architecture using just in time  compilation once instructions have been converted to native code they are  kept and will continue to run as native code for the cpu the architecture of  the clr for the net framework is shown in figure  compilation  clr c  source  ms il  assembly vb net  source  ms il  assembly  host system  figure architecture ofthe clr for the net framework   chapter   special java chip that executes the java bytecode operations as native code thus  bypassing the need for either a software interpreter or a just in tim e compiler  broadly is the activity of finding and fixing errors or in a  system debugging seeks to find and fix errors in both hardware and software  performance problems are considered bugs so debugging can also include  which seeks to improve performance by removing  in the processing taking place within a system a discussion of  hardware debugging is outside of the scope of this text in this section we  explore debugging kernel and process errors and performance problems   failure analysis  if a process fails most operating systems write the error information to a  to alert system operators or users that the problem occurred the operating  system can also take a capture of the memory referred to as the   core in the early days of computing of the process this core image is stored  in a file for later analysis running programs and core dumps can be probed  by a a tool designed to allow a programmer to explore the code and  memory a process  debugging user level process code is a challenge operating system kernel  debugging even more complex because of the size and complexity of the kernel  its control of the hardware and the lack of user level debugging tools a kernel  failure is called a as with a process failure error information is saved to  a log file and the memory state is saved to a  operating system debugging frequently uses different tools and techniques  than process debugging due to the very different nature of these two tasks  consider that a kernel failure in the file system code would make it risky for  the kernel to try to save its state to a file on the file system before rebooting  a common technique is to save the kernel s memory state to a section of disk  set aside for this purpose that contains no file system if the kernel detects  an unrecoverable error it writes the entire contents of memory or at least the  kernel owned parts of the system memory to the disk area when the system  reboots a process runs to gather the data from that area and write it to a crash  dump file within a file system for analysis   performance tuning  to identify bottlenecks we must be able to monitor system performance code  must be added to compute and display measures of system behavior in a  number of systems the operating system does this task by producing trace  listings of system behavior all interesting events are logged with their time and  important parameters and are written to a file later an analysis program can  process the log file to determine system performance and to identify bottlenecks  and inefficiencies these same traces can be run as input for a simulation of  a suggested improved system traces also can help people to find errors in  operating system behavior    kernighan s law   debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place therefore  if you write the code as cleverly as possible you are by definition not smart  enough to debug it  another approach to performance tuning is to include interactive tools  with the system that allow users and administrators to question the state of  various components of the system to look for bottlenecks the unix command  top displays resources used on the system as well as a sorted list of the top  resource using processes other tools display the state of disk i memory  allocation and network traffic the authors of these single purpose tools try to  guess what a user would want to see while analyzing a system and to provide  that information  making running operating systems easier to understand debug and tune  is an active area of operating system research and implementation the cycle  of enabling tracing as system problems occur and analyzing the traces later  is being broken by a new generation of kernel enabled performance analysis  tools further these tools are not single purpose or merely for sections of code  that were written to emit debugging data the solaris dtrace dynamic  tracing facility is a leading example of such a tool   dtrace  is a facility that dynamically adds probes to a running system both  i user processes and in the kernel these probes can be queried via the d  programming language to determine an astonishing amount about the kernel  the system state and process activities for example figure follows an  application as it executes a system call ioctl and further shows the functional  calls within the kernel as they execute to perform the system call lines ending  with u are executed in user mode and lines ending in k in kernel mode  debugging the interactions between user level and kernel code is nearly  impossible without a toolset that understands both sets of code and can  instrument the interactions for that toolset to be truly useful it must be able  to debug any area of a system including areas that were not written with  debugging in mind and do so without affecting system reliability this tool  must also have a minimum performance impact ideally it should have no  impact when not in use and a proportional impact during use the dtrace tool  meets these requirements and provides a dynamic safe low impact debugging  environncent  until the dtrace framework and tools became available with solaris  kernel debugging was usually shrouded in mystery and accomplished via  happenstance and archaic code and tools for example cpus have a breakpoint  feature that will halt execution and allow a debugger to examine the state of the  system then execution can continue until the next breakpoint or termination  this method cannot be used in a multiuser operating system kernel without  negatively affecting all of the users on the system pn reen g which periodically  samples the instruction pointer to determine which code is being executed can  show statistical trends but not individual activities code can be included in  the kernel to emit specific data under specific circumstances but that code   chapter  figure solaris dtrace follows a system call within the kernel  slows down the kernel and tends not to be included in the part of the kernel  where the specific problem being debugged is occurring  in contrast dtrace runs on production systems systems that are running  important or critical applications and causes no harm to the system it  slows activities while enabled but after execution it resets the system to its  pre debugging state it is also a broad and deep tool it can broadly debug  everything happening in the system both at the user and kernel levels and  between the user and kernel layers dtrace can also delve deeply into code  showing individual cpu instructions or kernel subroutine activities  is composed of a compiler a framework of  written within that framework and of those probes dtrace  providers create probes kernel structures exist to keep track of all probes that  the providers have created the probes are stored in a hash table data structure  that is hashed by name and indexed according to unique probe identifiers  when a probe is enabled a bit of code in the area to be probed is rewritten  to call dtrace probe probe identifier and then continue with the code s  original operation different providers create different kinds of probes for  example a kernel system call probe works differently from a user process  probe and that is different from an i o probe  dtrace features a compiler that generates a byte code that is run in the  kernel this code is assured to be safe by the compiler for example no    loops are allowed and only specific kernel state modifications are allowed  when specifically requested only users with the dtrace privileges or root  users are allowed to use dt ·ace as it can retrieve private kernel data and  modify data if requested the generated code runs in the kernel and enables  probes it also enables consumers in user mode and enables communications  between the two  a dt ·ace consumer is code that is interested in a probe and its results  a consumer requests that the provider create one or more probes when a  probe fires it emits data that are managed by the kernel within the kernel  actions called or are performed when probes  fire one probe can cause multiple ecbs to execute if more than one consumer  is interested in that probe each ecb contains a predicate if statement that  can filter out that ecb otherwise the list of actions in the ecb is executed the  most usual action is to capture some bit of data such as a variable s value at  that point of the probe execution by gathering such data a complete picture of  a user or kernel action can be built further probes firing from both user space  and the kernel can show how a user level action caused kernel level reactions  such data are invaluable for performance monitoril g and code optimization  once the probe consumer tennil ates its ecbs are removed if there are no  ecbs consuming a probe the probe is removed that involves rewriting the  code to remove the dtrace probe call and put back the original code thus  before a probe is created and after it is destroyed the system is exactly the  same as if no probing occurred  dtrace takes care to assure that probes do not use too much memory or  cpu capacity which could harm the running system the buffers used to hold  the probe results are monitored for exceeding default and maximum limits  cpu time for probe execution is monitored as well if limits are exceeded the  consumer is terminated along with the offending probes buffers are allocated  per cpu to avoid contention and data loss  an example ofd code and its output shows some of its utility the following  program shows the dtrace code to enable scheduler probes and record the  amount of cpu time of each process running with user id while those  probes are enabled that is while the program nms  sched on cpu  uid     self ts timestamp    sched  off cpu  self ts     ©time execname  self ts  sum timestamp self ts  the output of the program showing the processes and how much time in  nanoseconds they spend running on the cpus is shown in figure   chapter   dtrace s sched d  dtrace script sched d matched probes  ac  grwme settings d  gnome vfs daemon  dsdm  wnck applet  gnome panel

operating system  it is being added to other operating systems when those systems do not  have conflicting license agreements for example dtrace has been added to  mac os x and freebsd and will likely spread further due to its unique  capabilities other operating systems especially the linux derivatives are  adding kernel tracing functionality as well still other operating systems are  beginning to include performance and tracing tools fostered by research at  various institutions including the paradyn project  it is possible to design code and implement an operating system specifically  for one machine at one site more commonly however operating systems  are designed to nm on any of a class of machines at a variety of sites with  a variety of peripheral configurations the system must then be configured  or generated for each specific computer site a process sometimes known as  system generation sysgen  the operating system is normally distributed on disk on cd rom or  dvd rom or as an iso image which is a file in the format of a cd rom  or dvd rom to generate a system we use a special program this sysgen  program reads from a given file or asks the operator of the system for  information concerning the specific configuration of the hardware systenc or  probes the hardware directly to determine what components are there the  following kinds of information must be determined  what cpu is to be used what options extended instruction sets floating\\xad point arithmetic and so on are installed for multiple cpu systems each  cpu may be described     how will the boot disk be formatted how many sections or partitions  will it be separated into and what will go into each partition  how much memory is available some systems will determine this value  themselves by referencing memory location after memory location until an   illegal address fault is generated this procedure defines the final legal  address and hence the amount of available memory  what devices are available the system will need to know how to address  each device the device number the device interrupt number the device s  type and model and any special device characteristics  what operating system options are desired or what parameter values are  to be used these options or values might include how many buffers of  which sizes should be used what type of cpu scheduling algorithm is  desired what the maximum number of processes to be supported is and  so on  once this information is determined it can be used in several ways at one  extreme a system administrator can use it to modify a copy of the source code of  the operating system the operating system then is completely compiled data  declarations initializations and constants along with conditional compilation  produce an output object version of the operating system that is tailored to the  system described  at a slightly less tailored level the system description can lead to the  creation of tables and the selection of modules from a precompiled library  these modules are linked together to form the generated operating system  selection allows the library to contain the device drivers for all supported i  devices but only those needed are linked into the operating system because  the system is not recompiled system generation is faster but the resulting  system may be overly general  at the other extreme it is possible to construct a system that is completely  table driven all the code is always part of the system and selection occurs at  execution time rather than at compile or lil k time system generation involves  simply creating the appropriate tables to describe the system  the major differences among these approaches are the size and generality  of the generated system and the ease of modifying it as the hardware  configuration changes consider the cost of modifying the system to support a  newly acquired graphics termil al or another disk drive balanced against that  cost of course is the frequency or infrequency of such changes  after an operating system is generated it must be made available for use by  the hardware but how does the hardware know where the kernel is or how to  load that kernel the procedure of starting a computer by loading the kernel  is known as booting the system on most computer systems a small piece of  code known as the bootstrap program or bootstrap loader locates the kernel  loads it into main memory and starts its execution some computer systems  such as pcs use a two step process in which a simple bootstrap loader fetches  a more complex boot program from disk which in turn loads the kernel   chapter   when a cpu receives a reset event for instance when it is powered up  or rebooted the instruction register is loaded with a predefined memory  location and execution starts there at that location is the initial bootstrap  program this program is in the form of read only memory rom because  the ram is in an unknown state at system startup rom is convenient because  it needs no initialization and cannot easily be infected by a computer virus  the bootstrap program can perform a variety of tasks usually one task  is to run diagnostics to determine the state of the machine if the diagnostics  pass the program can continue with the booting steps it can also initialize all  aspects of the system from cpu registers to device controllers and the contents  of main memory sooner or later it starts the operating system  some systems such as cellular phones pdas and game consoles store  the entire operating system in rom storing the operating system in rom is  suitable for small operating systems simple supporting hardware and rugged  operation a problem with this approach is that changing the bootstrap code  requires changing the rom hardware chips some systems resolve this problem  by using erasable programmable read only memory eprom which is read\\xad only except when explicitly given a command to become writable all forms  of rom are also known as firmware since their characteristics fall somewhere  between those of hardware and those of software a problem with firmware  in general is that executing code there is slower thart executing code in ram  some systems store the operating system in firmware and copy it to ram for  fast execution a final issue with firmware is that it is relatively expensive so  usually only small ammmts are available  for large operating systems including most general purpose operating  systems like windows mac os x and unix or for systems that change  frequently the bootstrap loader is stored in firmware and the operating system  is on disk in this case the bootstrap nms diagnostics and has a bit of code  that can read a single block at a fixed location say block zero from disk into  memory and execute the code from that b ock the program stored in the  boot block may be sophisticated enough to load the entire operating system  into memory and begin its execution more typically it is simple code as it fits  in a single disk block and knows only the address on disk and length of the  remainder of the bootstrap program is an example of an open source  bootstrap program for linux systems all of the disk bound bootstrap and the  operating system itself can be easily changed by writing new versions to disk  a disk that has a boot partition more on that in section  is called a boot  disk or system disk  now that the full bootsh·ap program has been loaded it can traverse the  file system to find the operating system kernel load it into memory and start  its execution it is only at this point that the system is said to be running  operating systems provide a number of services at the lowest level system  calls allow a running program to make requests from the operating system  directly at a higher level the command interpreter or shell provides a  mechanism for a user to issue a request without writing a program commands  may come from files during batch mode execution or directly from a terminal    when in an interactive or time shared mode system programs are provided to  satisfy many common u ser requests  the types of requests vary accord ilcg to level the system call level must  provide the basic functions such as process control and file and device  manipulation higher level requests satisfied by the command interpreter or  system programs are translated into a sequence of system calls system services  can be classified into several categories program controt status requests  and i requests program errors can be considered implicit requests for  service  once the system services are defined the structure of the operating system  can be developed various tables are needed to record the information that  defines the state of the computer system and the status of the system s jobs  the design of a new operating system is a major task it is important that  the goals of the system be well def ilced before the design begins the type of  system desired is the foundation for choices among various algorithms and  strategies that will be needed  s iilce an operating system is large modularity is important designing a  system as a sequence of layers or using a microkernel is considered a good  technique the virtual machine concept takes the layered approach and treats  both the kernel of the operat ilcg system and the hardware as though they were  hardware even other operating systems may be loaded on top of this virtual  machine  throughout the entire operating system design cycle we must be careful  to separate policy decisions from implementation details mechanisms this  separation allows maximum flexibility if policy decisions are to be changed  later  operating systems are now almost always written in a systems\\xad implementation language or in a higher level language this feature improves  their implementation maintenance and portability to create an operating  system for a particular machine configuration we must perform system  generation  debugging process and kernel failures can be accomplished through the  use of de buggers and other tools that analyze core dumps tools such as dtrace  analyze production systems to fucd bottlenecks and understand other system  behavior  for a computer system to begin running the cpu must initialize and start  executing the bootstrap program in firmware the bootstrap can execute the  operating system directly if the operating system is also in the firmware or  it can complete a sequence in which it

sure to include all necessary error  checking including ensuring that the source file exists  once you have correctly designed and tested the program if  you used a system that supports it run the program using a utility  that traces system calls linux systems provide the ptrace utility and  solaris systems use the truss or dtrace command on mac os x the  ktrace facility provides similar functionality as windows systems do  not provide such features you will have to trace through the win  version of this program using a debugger   adding a system call to the linux kernel  in this project you will study the system call interface provided by the  linux operating system and learn how user programs communicate with  the operating system kernel via this interface your task is to icorporate  a new system call into the kernet thereby expanding the functionality  of the operating system  part getting started  a user mode procedure call is performed by passing arguments to the  called procedure either on the stack or through registers saving the  current state and the value of the program counter and jumping to  the beginning of the code corresponding to the called procedure the  process continues to have the same privileges as before  system calls appear as procedure calls to user programs but result i  a change in execution context and privileges in linux on the intel  architecture a system call is accomplished by storing the system call  number into the eax register storing arguments to the system call in  other hardware registers and executing a trap instruction which is the   chapter  int ox assembly instruction after the trap is executed the system\\xad call number is used to index into a table of code pointers to obtain the  starting address for the handler code implementing the system call the  process then juxnps to this address and the privileges of the process  are switched from user to kernel mode with the expanded privileges  the process can now execute kernel code which may include privileged  instructions that cannot be executed in user mode the kernel code  can then carry out the requested services such as interacting with i o  devices and can perform process management and other activities that  cannot be performed in user mode  the system call numbers for recent versions of the linux ker\\xad nel are listed in lusr i src linux xl include asm i unistd h   for instance  nr close corresponds to the system call close which  is invoked for closin g a file descriptor and is defined as value the  list of pointers to system call handlers is typically stored in the file  lusrlsrcllinux x arch i kernel entry s under the head\\xad ing entry sys calltable notice that sys close is stored at entry  number in the table to be consistent with the system call number  defined in the unistd h file the keyword long denotes that the entry  will occupy the same number of bytes as a data value of type long  part building a new kernel  before adding a system call to the kernel you must familiarize yourself  with the task of building the binary for a kernel from its source code and  booting the machine with the newly built kernel this activity comprises  the following tasks some of which depend on the particular installation  of the linux operating system in use  obtain the kernel source code for the linux distribution if the  source code package has already been installed on your machine  the corresponding files might be available under lusr i srcllinux  or usr i src linux x where the suffix corresponds to the kernel  version number if the package has not yet been installed it can be  downloaded from the provider of your linux distribution or from  http l www kernel org  learn how to configure compile and install the kernel binary this  will vary among the different kernel distributions but some typical  commands for building the kernel after entering the directory  where the kernel source code is stored include  o make xconfig  o make dep  o make bzimage  add a new entry to the set of boatable kernels supported by the  system the linux operating system typically uses utilities such as  lilo and grub to maintain a list ofbootable kernels from which the    user can choose during machine boot up if your system supports  lilo add an entry to lilo conf such as  image boot bzimage mykernel  label mykernel  root dev hda  read only  where lbootlbzimage my kernel is the kernel image and my kernel  is the label associated with the new kernel this step will allow  you to choose the new kernel during the boot up process you will  then have the option of either booting the new kernel or booting  the unmodified kernel if the newly built kernel does not ftmction  properly  part extending the kernel source  you can now experiment with adding a new file to the set of source  files used for compiling the kernel typically the source code is stored  in the lusr i srcllinux xlkernel directory although that location  may differ in your linux distribution there are two options for adding  the system call the first is to add the system call to an existing source file  in this directory the second is to create a new file in the source directory  and modify lusr i srcllinux xlkernelimakef ile to include the  newly created file in the compilation process the advantage of the first  approach is that when you modify an existing file that is already part of  the compilation process the makefile need not be modified  part adding a system call to the kernel  now that you are familiar with the various background tasks corre\\xad sponding to building and booting linux kernels you can begin the  process of adding a new system call to the linux kernel in this project  the system call will have limited functionality it will simply transition  from user mode to kernel mode print a message that is logged with the  kernel messages and transition back to user mode we will call this the  helloworld system call while it has only limited functionality it illustrates  the system call mechanism and sheds light on the interaction between  user programs and the kernel  create a new file called helloworld c to define your system call  include the header files linuxllinkage h and linuxlkernel h  add the following code to this file   include linuxllinkage h   include linuxlkernel h  asmlinkage int sysjhelloworld   printk kern emerg hello world   return     chapter  this creates a system call with the name sys helloworld  if you  choose to add this system call to an existing file in the source  directory all that is necessary is to add the sys hellowor ld  function to the file you choose in the code asmlinkage is  a rellli ant from the days when linux used both c and c  code and is used to indicate that the code is written in c the  printk function is used to print messages to a kernel log file  and therefore may be called only from the kernel the kernel mes\\xad sages specified in the parameter to printk are logged in the  file var log kernel warnings the function prototype for the  printk call is defined in usr include linux kernel h  define a new system call number for nr helloworld in   usr src linux x include asm i unistd h a user  program can use this number to identify the newly added system  call also be sure to increment the value for nr syscalls which  is stored in the same file this constant tracks the number of system  calls currently defuced in the kernel  add an entry long sys helloworld to the sys calltable  definedinthe usr src linux x arch i kernel entry s  file as discussed earlier the system call number is used to index  into this table to find the position of the handler code for the  invoked system call  add your file helloworld c to the makefile if you created a new  file for your system call save a copy of your old kernel binary  image in case there are problems with your newly created kernel  you can now build the new kernet rename it to distinguish it from  the unmodified kernet and add an entry to the loader configuration  files such as lilo conf after completing these steps you can boot  either the old kernel or the new kernel that contains your system  call  part using the system call from a user program  when you boot with the new kernet it will support the newly defined  system call you now simply need to invoke this system call from a  user program ordinarily the standard c library supports an interface  for system calls defined for the linux operating system as your new  system call is not linked into the standard c library however invoking  your system call will require manual intervention  as noted earlier a system call is invoked by storing the appropriate  value in a hardware register and performing a trap instruction unfortu\\xad nately these low level operations cannot be performed using c language  statements and instead require assembly instructions fortunately linux  provides macros for instantiating wrapper functions that contain the  appropriate assembly instructions for instance the following c pro\\xad gram uses the syscallo macro to invoke the newly defined system  call   include linux errno h   include sys syscall h   include linux unistd h   syscallo int helloworld  main    helloworld    the syscallo macro takes two arguments the first specifies the  type of the value returned by the system call the second is the  name of the system call the name is used to identify the system\\xad call number that is stored in the hardware register before the trap  instruction is executed if your system call requires arguments then  a different macro such as syscallo where the suffix indicates the  number of arguments could be used to instantiate the assembly  code required for performing the system call  compile and execute the program with the newly built kernel  there should be a message hello world in the kernel log file   var log kernel warnings to indicate that the system call has  executed  as a next step consider expanding the functionality of your system call  how would you pass an integer value or a character string to the system  call and have it printed illto the kernel log file what are the implications  of passing pointers to data stored in the user program s address space  as opposed to simply passing an integer value from the user program to  the kernel using hardware registers  dijkstra advocated the layered approach to operating system desigll  brinch hansen was an early proponent of constructing an

and devices   to accomplish its task these resources are allocated to the process  either when it is created or while it is executing  a process is the unit of work in most systems systems consist of  a collection of processes operating system processes execute system  code and user processes execute user code all these processes may  execute concurrently  although traditionally a process contained only a single thread of  control as it ran most modem operating systems now support processes  that have multiple threads  the operating system is responsible for the following activities in  connection with process and thread management the creation and  deletion of both user and system processes the scheduling of processes  and the provision of mechanisms for synchronization communication  and deadlock handling for processes    chapter  early computer systems allowed only one program to be executed at a  time this program had complete control of the system and had access to  all the system s resources in contrast current day computer systems allow  multiple programs to be loaded into memory and executed concurrently  this evolution required firmer control and more compartmentalization of the  various programs and these needs resulted in the notion of a process which is  a program in execution a process is the unit of work in a modern time sharing  system  the more complex the operating system is the more it is expected to do on  behalf of its users although its main concern is the execution of user programs  it also needs to take care of various system tasks that are better left outside the  kernel itself a system therefore consists of a collection of processes operating\\xad system processes executing system code and user processes executing user  code potentially all these processes can execute concurrently with the cpu or  cpus multiplexed among them by switching the cpu between processes the  operating system can make the computer more productive in this chapter you  will read about what processes are and how they work  to introduce the notion of a process a program in execution which forms  the basis of all computation  to describe the various features of processes including scheduling  creation and termination and communication  to describe communication in client server systems  windows a user may be able to run several programs at one time a word  processor a web browser and an e mail package and even if the user can  execute only one program at a time the operating system may need to support  its own internal programmed activities such as memory management in many  respects all these activities are similar so we call all of them processes   the process  informally as mentioned earlier a process is a program in execution a process  is more than the program code which is sometimes known as the text section  it also includes the current activity as represented by the value of the program  counter and the contents of the processor s registers a process generally also  includes the process stack which contains temporary data such as function  parameters return addresses and local variables and a data section which  contains global variables a process may also include a heap which is memory  thatis dynamically allocated during process run time the structure of a process  in memory is shown in figure  we emphasize that a program by itself is not a process a program is a passive  entity such as a file containing a list of instructions stored on disk often called  an executable file whereas a process is an active entity with a program counter  specifying the next instruction to execute and a set of associated resources a  program becomes a process when an executable file is loaded into memory  two common techniques for loading executable files are double clicking an  icon representing the executable file and entering the name of the executable  file on the command line as in prog exe or a out  figure process in memory     or event completion  figure diagram of process state  although two processes may be associated with the same program they  are nevertheless considered two separate execution sequences for instance  several users may be running different copies of the mail program or the same  user may invoke many copies of the web browser program each of these is a  separate process and although the text sections are equivalent the data heap  and stack sections vary it is also common to have a process that spawns many  processes as it runs we discuss such matters in section   process state  as a proces excr utes it changes state the state of a process is defil ed in  part by the current activity of that process each process may be in one of the  following states  new the process is being created  running instructions are being executed  waiting the process is waiting for some event to occur such as an i  completion or reception of a signal  ready the process is waiting to be assigned to a processor  terminated the process has finished execution  these names are arbitrary and they vary across operating systems the states  that they represent are found on all systems however certain operating  systems also more finely delineate process states it is important to realize  that only one process can be running on any processor at any instant many  processes may be ready and waiting however the state diagram corresponding  to these states is presented in figure   process control block  figure process control block pcb  process state  program counter the counter indicates the address of the next instruction  to be executed for this process  cpu registers the registers vary in number and type depending on  the computer architecture they mclude accumulators index registers  stack pointers and general purpose registers plus any condition code  information along with the program counter this state information must  be saved when an mterrupt occurs to allow the process to be continued  correctly afterward figure   cpu scheduling information this information includes a process priority  pointers to scheduling queues and any other scheduling parameters   chapter describes process scheduling  memory management information this information may include such  information as the value of the base and limit registers the page tables  or the segment tables dependmg on the memory system used by the  operating system chapter  accounting information this mformation includes the amount of cpu  and real time used time limits account numbers job or process numbers  and so on  i o status information this information includes the list of i o devices  allocated to the process a list of open files and so on  in briet the pcb simply serves as the repository for any information that may  vary from process to process   threads  the process model discussed so far has implied that a process is a program  that performs a single thread of execution for example when a process is  running a word processor program a single thread of instructions is being  executed this single thread of control allows the process to perform only one   process p  idle  operating system  interrupt or system call  figure diagram showing cpu switch from process to process  task at one time the user cannot simultaneously type in characters and run the  spell checker within the same process for example many modern operatin g  systems have extended the process concept to allow a process to have multiple  threads of execution and thus to perform more than one task at a time on a  system that supports threads the pcb is expanded to include information for  each thread other changes throughout the system are also needed to support  threads chapter explores multithreaded processes in detail  the objective of multiprogramming is to have some process nnming at all  times to maximize cpu utilization the objective of time sharing is to switch the  cpu among processes so frequently that users can interact with each program  while it is run ning to meet these objectives the process scheduler selects  an available process possibly from a set of several available processes for  program execution on the cpu for a single processor system there will never  be more than one running process if there are more processes the rest will  have to wait until the cpu is free and can be rescheduled   scheduling queues  as processes enter the system they are put into a job queue which consists  of all processes in the system the processes that are residing in main memory  and are ready and waiting to execute are kept on a list called the ready queue   chapter  process representation in linux  the process control block in the linux operating system is represented  by the c struchre task struct this structure contains all the necessary  information for representing a process including the state of the process  scheduling and memory management information list of open files and  pointers to the process s parent and any of its children a process s parent is  the process that created it its children are any processes that it creates some  of these fields include  pid t pid i process identifier i  long state i state of the process i  unsigned int time slice i scheduling information i  struct task struct parent i this process s parent i  struct list head children i this process s children i  struct files struct files i list of open files i  struct mm struct mm i address space of this process i  for example the state of a process isrepresented by the field long state  in this structure within the linux kernel all active processes are represented  using a doubly linked list of task struct and the kernel maintains a pointer   current to the process currently executing on the system this is shown  in figure  struct task struct  process information struct task struct  process information  t  current   currently executing proccess  figure active processes in linux struct task struct  process information  as an illustration of how the kernel might manipulate one of the fields in  the task struct for a specified process let s assume the system would like  to change the state of the process currently running to the value new state  if currentis a pointer to the process currently executing its state is changed  with the following  current state new state  this queue is generally stored as a linked list a ready queue header contains  pointers to the first and final pcbs in the list each pcb includes a pointer field  that points to the next pcb in the ready queue    queue header  mag  tape c    unit k t r il  figure the ready queue and various device queues  the system also includes other queues when a process is allocated the  cpu it executes for a while and eventually quits is interrupted or waits for  the occurrence of a particular event such as the completion of an i request  suppose the process makes an i o request to a shared device such as a disk  since there are many processes in the system the disk may be busy with the  i request of some other process the process therefore may have to wait for  the disk the list of processes waiting for a particular i device is called a  device queue each device has its own device queue figure   a common representation of process scheduling is a queueing diagram  such as that in figure each rectangular box represents a queue two types  of queues are present the ready queue and a set of device queues the circles  represent the resources that serve the queues and the arrows indicate the flow  of processes in the system  a new process is initially put in the ready queue it waits there until it is  selected for execution or is dispatched once the process is allocated the cpu  and is executing one of several events could occur  the process could issue an i request and then be placed in an i queue  the process could create a new subprocess and wait for the subprocess s  termination  the process could be removed forcibly from the cpu as a result of an  interrupt and be put back in the ready queue   chapter  figure queueing diagram representation of process scheduling  in the first two cases the process eventually switches from the waiting state  to the ready state and is then put back in the ready queue a process continues  this cycle until it terminates at which time it is removed from all queues and  has its pcb and resources deallocated   schedulers  a process migrates among the various scheduling queues throughout its  lifetime the operating system must select for scheduling purposes processes  from these queues in some fashion the selection process is carried out by the  appropriate scheduler  often in a batch system more processes are submitted than can be executed  immediately these processes are spooled to a mass storage device typically a  disk where they are kept for later execution the long term scheduler or job  scheduler selects processes from this pool and loads them into memory for  execution the short term scheduler or cpu scheduler selects from among  the processes that are ready to execute and allocates the cpu to one of them  the primary distinction between these two schedulers lies in frequency  of execution the short term scheduler must select a new process for the cpu  frequently a process may execute for only a few milliseconds before waiting  for an i request often the short term scheduler executes at least once every   milliseconds because of the short time between executions the short term  scheduler must be fast if it takes milliseconds to decide to execute a process  for milliseconds then i   percent of the cpu is being used   wasted simply for scheduling the work  the long term scheduler executes much less freqvently minutes may sep\\xad arate the creation of one new process and the next the long term scheduler  controls the degree of multiprogramming the number of processes in mem\\xad ory if the degree of multiprogramming is stable then the average rate of  process creation must be equal to the average departure rate of processes  leaving the system thus the long term scheduler may need to be invoked    only when a process leaves the system because of the longer interval between  executions the long term scheduler can afford to take more tin e to decide  which process should be selected for execution  it is important that the long term scheduler make a careful selection in  general most processes can be described as either i bound or cpu bound an  i o bound process is one that spends more of its time doing i o than it spends  doing computations a cpu bound process in contrast generates i requests  infrequently using more of its time doing computations it is important that the  long term scheduler select a good process mix of i o bound and cpu bound  processes if all processes are i bound the ready queue will almost always  be empty and the short term scheduler will have little to do if all processes  are cpu bound the i waiting queue will almost always be empty devices  will go unused and again the system will be unbalanced the system with the  best performance will thus have a combination of cpu bound and i o bound  processes  on some systems the long term scheduler may be absent or minimal  for example time sharing systems such as unix and microsoft windows  systems often have no long term scheduler but simply put every new process in  memory for the short term scheduler the stability of these systems depends  either on a physical limitation such as the number of available terminals  or on the self adjusting nature of human users if performance declines to  m acceptable levels on a multiuser system some users will simply quit  some operating systems such as time sharing systems may introduce an  additional intermediate level of scheduling this medium term scheduler is  diagrammed in figure the key idea behind a medium term scheduler  is that sometimes it can be advantageous to remove processes from mem\\xad ory and from active contention for the cpu and thus reduce the degree  of multiprogramrning later the process can be reintroduced into memory  and its execution can be continued where it left off this scheme is called  swapping the process is swapped out and is later swapped in by the  medium term scheduler swapping may be necessary to improve the pro\\xad cess mix or because a change in memory requirements has overcommitted  available memory requiring memory to be freed up swapping is discussed in  chapter  swap in partiaii exec t d  •swpped out processes· swap out  figure addition of medium term scheduling to the queueing diagram   chapter    context switch  as mentioned in section  interrupts cause the operating system to change  a cpu from its current task and to run a kernel routine such operations happen  frequently on general purpose systems when an interrupt occurs the system  needs to save the current of the process running on the cpu so that  it can restore that context when its processing is done essentially suspending  the process and then resuming it the context is represented in the pcb of the  process it includes the value of the cpu registers the process state see figure   and memory management information generically we perform a  of the current state of the cpu be it in kernel or user mode and then a  to resu me operations  switching the cpu to another process requires performing a state save  of the current process and a state restore of a different process this task is  known as a when a context switch occurs the kernel saves the  context of the old process in its pcb and loads the saved context of the new  process scheduled to run context switch time is pure overhead because the  system does no useful work while switching its speed varies from machine to  machine depending on the memory speed the number of registers that must  be copied and the existence of special instructions such as a single instruction  to load or store all registers typical speeds are a few milliseconds  context switch times are highly dependent on hardware support for  instance some processors such as the sun ultrasparc provide multiple sets  of registers a context switch here simply requires changing the pointer to the  current register set of course if there are more active processes than there are  register sets the system resorts to copying register data to and from memory  as before also the more complex the operating system the more work must  be done during a context switch as we will see in chapter advanced  memory management techniques may require extra data to be switched with  each context for instance the address space of the current process must be  preserved as the space of the next task is prepared for use how the address  space is preserved and what amount of work is needed to preserve it depend  on the memory management method of the operating system  the processes in most systems can execute concurrently and they may  be created and deleted dynamically thus these systems must provide a  mechanism for process creation and termination in this section we explore  the n echanisms involved in creating processes and illustrate process creation  on unix and windows systems   process creation  a process may create several new processes via a create process system call  during the course of execution the creating process is called a parent process  and the new processes are called the children of that process each of these  new processes may in turn create other processes forming a tree of processes  most operating systems including unix and the windows family of  operating systems identify processes according to a unique process identifier     or pid which is typically an integer number figure illustrates a typical  process tree for the solaris operating system showing the name of each process  and its pid in solaris the process at the top of the tree is the sched process  with pid of the sched process creates several children processes including  pageout and fsflush these processes are responsible for managing memory  and file systems the sched process also creates the ini t process which serves  as the root parent process for all user processes in figure we see two  children of ini t inetd and dtlogin inetd is responsible for networking  services such as telnet and ftp dtlogin is the process representing a user  login screen when a user logs in dtlogin creates an x windows session   xsession which in turns creates the sdt shel process below sdlshel a  user s command line shell the c shell or csh is created in this command\\xad line interface the user can then invoke various child processes such as the ls  and cat commands we also see a csh process with pid of representing a  user who has logged onto the system using telnet this user has started the  netscape browser pid of and the emacs editor pid of  on unix we can obtain a listing of processes by using the ps command for  example the command ps el will list complete information for all processes  currently active in the system it is easy to construct a process tree similar to  what is shown in figure by recursively tracing parent processes all the way  to the ini t process  in general a process will need certain resources cpu time memory files  i devices to accomplish its task when a process creates a subprocess that  inetd  pid dtlogin  pid  figure a tree of processes on a typical solaris system   chapter  subprocess may be able to obtain its resources directly from the operating  system or it may be constrained to a subset of the resources of the parent  process the parent may have to partition its resources among its children  or it may be able to share some resources such as ncemory or files among  several of its children restricting a child process to a subset of the parent s  resources prevents any process from overloading the system by creating too  many subprocesses  in addition to the various physical and logical resources that a process  obtains when it is created initialization data input may be passed along by  the parent process to the child process for example consider a process whose  function is to display the contents of a file say img jpg on the screen of a  terminal when it is created it will get as an input from its parent process  the name of the file img jpg and it will use that file name open the file and  write the contents out it may also get the name of the output device some  operating systems pass resources to child processes on such a system the  new process may get two open files img jpg and the terminal device and may  simply transfer the datum between the two  when a process creates a new process two possibilities exist in terms of  execution  the parent continues to execute concurrently with its children  the parent waits until some or all of its children have terminated  there are also two possibilities in terms of the address space of the new process  the child process is a duplicate of the parent process it has the same  program and data as the parent  the child process has a new program loaded into it  to illustrate these differences let s first consider the unix operating system  in unix as we ve seen each process is identified by its process identifier  which is a tmique integer a new process is created by the fork system  call the new process consists of a copy of the address space of the original  process this mechanism allows the parent process to communicate easily with  its child process both processes the parent and the child continue execution  at the instruction after the fork  with one difference the return code for  the fork is zero for the new child process whereas the nonzero process  identifier of the child is returned to the parent  typically the exec system call is used after a fork system call by  one of the two processes to replace the process s memory space with a new  program the exec system call loads a binary file into memory destroying  the memory image of the program containing the exec system call and  starts its execution in this manner the two processes are able to communicate  and then go their separate ways the parent can then create more children or  if it has nothing else to do while the child runs it can issue await system  call to move itself off the ready queue until the termination of the child  the c program shown in figure illustrates the unix system calls  previously described we now have two different processes running copies of  the same program the only difference is that the value of pid the process     include sysltypes h   include stdio h   include unistd h  int main    pid t pid   i fork a child process i  pid fork  if pid  i error occurred i  fprintf stderr fork failed  return    else if pid  i child process i  execlp lbinlls ls null    else i parent process i   i parent will wait for the child to complete i  wait null  printf child complete  return  figure creating a separate process using the unix fork system call  identifier for the child process is zero while that for the parent is an integer  value greater than zero in fact it is the actual pid of the child process the  child process inherits privileges and scheduling attributes from the parent  as well certain resources such as open files the child process then overlays  its address space with the unix command lbin ls used to get a directory  listing using the execlp system call execlp is a version of the exec  system call the parent waits for the child process to complete with the wait  system call when the child process completes by either implicitly or explicitly  invoking exit  the parent process resumes from the call to wait where it  completes using the exit system call this is also illustrated in figure  parent wait resumes  child    exit  figure process creation using fork system call   chapter   include stdio h   include windows h  int main void    startupinfo si  process

windows  processes are created in the win api using the createprocess functionf  which is similar to fork in that a parent creates a new child process howeverf  whereas fork has the child process inheriting the address space of its parent  createprocess requires loading a specified program into the address space  of the child process at process creation furthermoref whereas fork is passed  no parametersf createprocess expects no fewer than ten parameters  the c program shown in figure illustrates the createprocess  functionf which creates a child process that loads the application mspaint ex e  we opt for many of the default values of the ten parameters passed to  createprocess  readers interested in pursuing the details of process    creation and management in the win api are encouraged to consult the  bibliographical notes at the end of this chapter  two parameters passed to createprocess are instances of the start\\xad upinfo and process information structures startupinfo specifies many  properties of the new process such as window size and appearance and han\\xad dles to standard input and output files the process information structure  contains a handle and the identifiers to the newly created process and its thread  we invoke the zeromemory function to allocate memory for each of these  structures before proceeding with createprocess   the first two parameters passed to createprocess are the application  name and command line parameters if the application name is null as  it is in this case the command line parameter specifies the application to  load in this instance we are loading the microsoft windows mspaint exe  application beyond these two initial parameters we use the default parameters  for inheriting process and thread handles as well as specifying no creation flags  we also use the parent s existing environment block and starting directory  last we provide two pointers to the startupinfo and process lnformation  structures created at the beginning of the program in figure the parent  process waits for the child to complete by invoking the wait system  call the equivalent of this in win is wai tforsingleobj ect  which is  passed a handle of the child process pi hprocess and waits for this  process to complete once the child process exits control returns from the  wai tforsingleobj ect function in the parent process   process termination  a process terminates when it finishes executing its final statement and asks the  operating system to delete it by using the exit system call at that point the  process may return a status value typically an integer to its parent process   via the wait system call all the resources of the process including  physical and virtual memory open files and i buffers are deallocated  by the operating system  termination can occur in other circumstances as well a process can cause  the termination of another process via an appropriate system call for example  terminateprocess in win usually such a system call can be invoked  only by the parent of the process that is to be terminated otherwise users  could arbitrarily kill each other s jobs note that a parent needs to know the  identities of its children thus when one process creates a new process the  identity of the newly created process is passed to the parent  a parent may terminate the execution of one of its children for a variety of  reasons such as these  the child has exceeded its usage of some of the resources that it has been  allocated to determine whether this has occurred the parent m ust have  a mechanism to inspect the state of its children  the task assigned to the child is no longer required  the parent is exiting and the operating system does not allow a child to  continue if its parent terminates   chapter   some systencs including vms do not allow a child to exist if its parent  has terminated in such systems if a process terminates either normally or  abnormally then all its children must also be terminated this phenomenon  referred to as cascading termination is normally initiated by the operating  system  to illustrate process execution and termination consider that in unix we  can terminate a process by using the exit system call its parent process  may wait for the termination of a child process by using the wait system  call the wait system call returns the process identifier of a terminated child  so that the parent can tell which of its children has terminated if the parent  terminates however all its children have assigned as their new parent the  ini t process thus the children still have a parent to collect their status and  execution statistics  processes executing concurrently in the operating system may be either  independent processes or cooperating processes a process is independent  if it cannot affect or be affected by the other processes executing in the system  any process that does not share data with any other process is independent a  process is cooperating if it can affect or be affected by the other processes  executing in the system clearly any process that shares data with other  processes is a cooperating process  there are several reasons for providing an environment that allows process  cooperation  information sharing since several users may be interested in the same  piece of information for instance a shared file we must provide an  environment to allow concurrent access to such information  computation speedup if we want a particular task to run faster we must  break it into subtasks each of which will be executing in parallel with the  others notice that such a speedup can be achieved only if the computer  has multiple processing elements such as cpus or i o channels  modularity we may want to construct the system in a modular fashion  dividing the system functions into separate processes or threads as we  discussed in chapter  convenience even an individual user may work on many tasks at the  same time for instance a user may be editing printing and compiling in  parallel  cooperating processes require an interprocess communication ipc mech\\xad anism that will allow them to exchange data and information there are two  fundamental models of interprocess communication  shared memory and   message passing in the shared memory model a region of memory that  is shared by cooperating processes is established processes can then exchange  information by reading and writing data to the shared region in the message\\xad passing model communication takes place by means of messages exchanged    process a process a      kernel   a b  figure communications models a message passing b shared memory  between the cooperating processes the two communications models are  conh·asted in figure  both of the models just discussed are common in operating systems and  many systems implement both message passing is useful for exchanging  smaller ammmts of data because no conflicts need be avoided message  passing is also easier to implement than is shared memory for intercomputer  communication shared memory allows maximum speed and convenience of  communication shared memory is faster than message passing as message\\xad passing system s are typically implemented using system calls and thus require  the more time consuming task of kernel irttervention in contrast in shared\\xad memory systems system calls are required only to establish shared memory  regions once shared memory is established all accesses are treated as routine  memory accesses and no assistance from the kernel is required in the  ren ainder of this section we explore each of these ipc models in more detail   shared memory systems  interprocess communication using shared memory requires communicating  processes to establish a region of shared memory typically a shared memory  region resides in the address space of the process creating the shared\\xad memory segment other processes that wish to communicate using this shared\\xad memory segment must attach it to their address space recall that normally the  operating system tries to prevent one process from accessing another process s  memory shared memory requires that two or more processes agree to remove  this restriction they can then excbange information by reading and writing  data in the shared areas the form of the data and the location are determined by  these processes and are not under the operating system s control the processes  are also responsible for ensuring that they are not writing to the same location  simultaneously   chapter  to illustrate the concept of cooperating processes let s consider the  producer consumer problem which is a common paradigm for cooperating  processes a producer process produces information that is consumed by a  consumer process for example a compiler may produce assembly code  which is consumed by an assembler the assembler in turn ncay produce  object modules which are consumed by the loader the producer consumer  problem also provides a useful metaphor for the client server paradigm we  generally think of a server as a producer and a client as a consumer for  example a web server produces that is provides html files and images  which are consumed that is read by the client web browser requesting the  resource  one solution to the producer consumer problem uses shared memory to  allow producer and consumer processes to run concurrently we must have  available a buffer of items that can be filled by the producer and emptied by  the consumer this buffer will reside in a region of memory that is shared  by the producer and consumer processes a producer can produce one item  while the consumer is consuming another item the producer and consumer  must be synchronized so that the consumer does not try to consume an item  that has not yet been produced  two types of buffers can be used the places no practical  limit on the size of the buffer the consumer may have to wait for new items  but the producer can always produce new items the assumes  a fixed buffer size in this case the consumer must wait if the buffer is empty  and the producer must wait if the buffer is full  let s look more closely at how the bounded buffer can be used to enable  processes to share memory the following variables reside in a region of  memory shared by the producer and consumer processes   define buffer size  typedef struct   item  item buffer buffer size  int in   int out   the shared buffer is implemented as a circular array with two logical  pointers in and out the variable in points to the next free position in the  buffer out points to the first full position in the buffer the buffer is empty  when in out the buffer is full when in  buffer size  out  the code for the producer and consumer processes is shown in figures  and respectively the producer process has a local variable nextproduced  in which the new item to be produced is stored the consumer process has a  local variable next consumed in which the item to be consumed is stored  this scheme allows at most buffer size items in the buffer at the same  time we leave it as an exercise for you to provide a solution where buffer size  items can be in the buffer at the same time in section  we illustrate the  posix api for shared memory    item nextproduced  while true   i produce an item in nextproduced i  while  in  buffer size  out   i do nothing i  buffer in nextproduced  in in  buffer size  figure the producer process  one issue this illustration does not address concerns the situation in which  both the producer process and the consumer process attempt to access the  shared buffer concurrently in chapter we discuss how synchronization  among cooperating processes can be implemented effectively in a shared\\xad memory environment   message passing systems  lrt section  we showed how cooperating processes can communicate in a  shared memory environment the scheme requires that these processes share a  region of memory and that the code for accessing and manipulating the shared  memory be written explicitly by the application programmer another way to  achieve the same effect is for the operating system to provide the means for  cooperating processes to comm lmicate with each other via a message passing  facility  message passing provides a mechanism to allow processes to communicate  and to synchronize their actions without sharing the same address space and  is particularly useful in a distributed environment where the communicating  processes may reside on different computers connected by a network for  example a chat program used on the world wide web could be designed so  that chat participants communicate with one another by exchanging messages  a message passing facility provides at least two operations send message  and recei ve message messages sent by a process can be of either fixed  or variable size if only fixed sized messages can be sent the system level  implementation is straightforward this restriction however makes the task  item nextconsumed  while true   while in out   ii do nothing  nextconsumed buffer out  out out  buffer size  i consume the item in nextconsumed i  figure the consumer process   chapter  of programming more difficult conversely variable sized messages require  a nore complex system level implementation but the programming task  becomes simpler this is a coitlmon kind of tradeoff seen throughout operating\\xad system design  if processes p and q want to communicate they must send messages to and  receive messages from each other a communication link must exist between  them this link can be implemented in a variety of ways we are concerned here  not with the link s physical implementation such as shared memory hardware  bus or network which are covered in chapter but rather with its logical  implementation here are several methods for logically implementing a link  and the send i receive operations  direct or indirect communication  synchronous or asynchronous communication  automatic or explicit buffering  we look at issues related to each of these features next   naming  processes that want to communicate must have a way to refer to each other  they can use either direct or indirect communication  under direct communication each process that wants to comm lmicate  must explicitly name the recipient or sender of the communication in this  scheme the send and receive primitives are defined as  send p message send a message to process p  receive q message receive a message from process q  a communication link in this scheme has the following properties  a link is established automatically between every pair of processes that  want to communicate the processes need to know only each other s  identity to communicate  a link is associated with exactly two processes  between each pair of processes there exists exactly one link  this scheme exhibits symmetry in addressing that is both the sender  process and the receiver process must name the other to communicate a  variant of this scheme employs asymmetry in addressing here only the sender  names the recipient the recipient is not required to name the sender in this  scheme the send and receive primitives are defined as follows  send p message send a message to process p  receive id message receive a message from any process the vari\\xad able id is set to the name of the process with which communication has  taken place  the disadvantage in both of these schemes symmetric and asymmetric  is the limited modularity of the resulting process definitions changing the  identifier of a process may necessitate examining all other process definitions  all references to the old identifier must be found so that they can be modified    to the new identifier in general any such hard coding techniques where  identifiers must be explicitly stated are less desirable than techniques involving  indirection as described next  with indirect communication the messages are sent to and received from  mailboxes or ports a mailbox can be viewed abstractly as an object into which  messages can be placed by processes and from which messages can be removed  each mailbox has a w ique identification for example posix message queues  use an integer value to identify a mailbox in this scheme a process can  communicate with some other process via a number of different mailboxes  two processes can communicate only if the processes have a shared mailbox  however the send and receive primitives are defined as follows  send a message send a message to mailbox a  receive a message receive a message from mailbox a  in this scheme a communication link has the following properties  a link is established between a pair of processes only if both members of  the pair have a shared mailbox  a link may be associated with more than two processes  between each pair of communicating processes there may be a number of  different links with each link corresponding to one mailbox  now suppose that processes p p and p all share mailbox a process  p sends a message to a while both p and p execute a receive from a  which process will receive the message sent by p the answer depends on  which of the following methods we choose  allow a link to be associated with two processes at most  allow at most one process at a time to execute a receive operation  allow the system to select arbitrarily which process will receive the  message that is either p or p but not both will receive the message  the system also may define an algorithm for selecting which process  will receive the message that is round robin where processes take turns  receiving messages the system may identify the receiver to the sender  a mailbox may be owned eith r by a process or by the operating system  if the mailbox is owned by a process that is the mailbox is part of the address  space of the process then we distinguish between the owner which can  only receive messages through this mailbox and the user which can only  send messages to the mailbox since each mailbox has a unique owner there  can be no confusion about which process should receive a message sent to  this mailbox when a process that owns a mailbox terminates the mailbox  disappears any process that subsequently sends a message to this mailbox  must be notified that the mailbox no longer exists  in contrast a mailbox that is owned by the operating system has an  existence of its own it is independent and is not attached to any particular  process the operating system then must provide a mechanism that allows a  process to do the following   chapter  create a new mailbox  send and receive messages through the mailbox  delete a mailbox  the process that creates a new mailbox is that mailbox s owner by default  initially the owner is the only process that can receive messages through this  n tailbox however the ownership and receiving privilege may be passed to  other processes through appropriate system calls of course this provision  could result in multiple receivers for each mailbox   synchronization  communication between processes takes place through calls to send and  receive primitives there are different design options for implementing  each primitive message passing may be either blocking or nonblocking\\xad also known as synchronous and asynchronous  blocking send the sending process is blocked until the message is  received by the receiving process or by the mailbox  nonblocking send the sending process sends the message and resumes  operation  blocking receive the receiver blocks until a message is available  nonblocking receive the receiver retrieves either a valid message or a  null  different combinations of send and receive are possible when both  send and receive are blocking we have a rendezvous between the  sender and the receiver the solution to the producer consumer problem  becomes trivial when we use blocking send and receive statements  the producer merely invokes the blocking send call and waits until the  message is delivered to either the receiver or the mailbox likewise when the  consumer invokes receive it blocks until a message is available  note that the concepts of synchronous and asynchronous occur frequently  in operating system i algorithms as you will see throughout this text   buffering  whether communication is direct or indirect messages exchanged by commu\\xad nicating processes reside in a temporary queue basically such queues can be  implemented in three ways  zero capacity the queue has a maximum length of zero thus the link  cannot have any messages waiting in it in this case the sender must block  until the recipient receives the message  bounded capacity the que ue has finite length n thus at most n messages  can reside in it if the queue is not full when a new message is sent the  message is placed in the queue either the message is copied or a pointer  to the message is kept and the sender can continue execution without     waiting the link s capacity is finite however if the link is full the sender  must block until space is available in the quelie  unbounded capacity the queue s length is potentially infinite thus any  number of messages can wait in it the sender never blocks  the zero capacity case is sometimes referred to as a message system with no  buffering the other cases are referred to as systems with automatic buffering  in this section we explore three different ipc systems we first cover the  posix api for shared memory and then discuss message passing in the mach  operating system we conclude with windows xp which interestingly uses  shared memory as a mechanism for providing certain types of message passing   an example posix shared memory  several ipc mechanisms are available for posix systems including shared  memory and message passing here we explore the posix api for shared  memory  a process must first create a shared memory segment using the shmget  system call shmget is derived from shared memory get the following  example illustrates the use of shmget   segment id shmget ipcprivate size s lrusr i s lwusr  this first parameter specifies the key or identifier of the shared memory  segment if this is set to ipcprivate a new shared memory segment is created  the second parameter specifies the size in bytes of the shared memory  segment finally the third parameter identifies the mode which indicates  how the shared memory segment is to be used that is for reading writing  or both by setting the mode to s lrusr s lwusr we are indicating that the  owner may read or write to the shared memory segment a successful call to  shmget returns an integer identifier for the shared memory segment other  processes that want to use this region of shared memory must specify this  identifier  processes that wish to access a shared memory segment must attach it to  their address space using the shmat  shared memory attach system call  the call to shmat expects three parameters as well the first is the integer  identifier of the shared memory segment being attached and the second is  a pointer location in memory indicating where the shared ncemory will be  attached if we pass a value of null the operating system selects the location  on the user s behalf the third parameter identifies a flag that allows the shared\\xad memory region to be attached in read only or read write mode by passing a  parameter of we allow both reads and writes to the shared region we attach  a region of shared memory using shmat as follows  shared memory char shmat id null   if successful shmat returns a pointer to the beginning location in memory  where the shared memory region has been attached   chapter  once the region of shared ncemory is attached to a process s address space  the process can access the shared memory as a routine memory access using  the pointer returned from shmat  in this example shmat returns a pointer  to a character string thus we could write to the shared memory region as  follows  sprintf shared memory writing to shared memory  other processes sharing this segment would see the updates to the shared\\xad memory segment  typically a process using an existing shared memory segment first attaches  the shared memory region to its address space and then accesses and possibly  updates the region of shared memory when a process no longer requires  access to the shared memory segment it detaches the segment from its address  space to detach a region of shared memory the process can pass the pointer  of the shared memory region to the shmdt system call as follows  shmdt shared memory  finally a shared memory segment can be removed from the system with the  shmctl system call which is passed the identifier of the shared segrnent  along with the flag ipcrmid  the program shown in figure illustrates the posix shared memory  api just discussed this program creates a byte shared memory segment  once the region of shared memory is attached the process writes the message  hi there to shared memory after outputting the contents of the updated  memory it detaches and removes the shared memory region we provide  further exercises using the posix shared memory api in the programming  exercises at the end of this chapter   an example mach  as an example of a message based operating system we next consider  the mach operating system developed at carnegie mellon university we  introduced mach in chapter as part of the mac os x operating system the  mach kernel supports the creation and destruction of multiple tasks which are  similar to processes but have multiple threads of control most communication  in mach including most of the system calls and all intertask information\\xad is carried out by messages messages are sent to and received from mailboxes  called ports in mach  even system calls are made by messages when a task is created two special  n tailboxes the kernel mailbox and the notify mailbox are also created the  kernel mailbox is used by the kernel to communicate with the task the kernel  sends notification of event occurrences to the notify port only three system  calls are needed for message transfer the msg send call sends a message  to a mailbox a message is received via msg recei ve  remote procedure  calls rpcs are executed via msg rpc which sends a message and waits for  exactly one return message from the sender in this way the rpc models a  typical subroutine procedure call but can work between systems hence the  term remote  the porlallocate system call creates a new mailbox and allocates  space for its queue of messages the maximum

illustrating posix shared memory api  defaults to eight messages the task that creates the mailbox is that mailbox s  owner the owner is also allowed to receive from the mailbox only one task  at a time can either own or receive from a mailbox but these rights can be sent  to other tasks if desired  the mailbox s message queue is initially empty as messages are sent to  the mailbox the messages are copied into the mailbox all messages have the  same priority mach guarantees that multiple messages from the same sender  are queued in first in first out fifo order but does not guarantee an absolute  ordering for instance messages from two senders may be queued in any order  the messages themselves consist of a fixed length header followed by a  variable length data portion the header indicates the length of the message  and indudes two mailbox names one mailbox name is the mailbox to which  the message is being sent commonly the sending thread expects a reply so   chapter  the mailbox name of the sender is passed on to the receiving task which can  use it as a return address  the variable part of a message is a list of typed data items each entry  in the list has a type size and value the type of the objects specified in the  message is important since objects defined by the operating system such as  ownership or receive access rights task states and memory segments n ay  be sent in messages  the send and receive operations themselves are flexible for instance when  a message is sent to a mailbox the mailbox may be full if the mailbox is not  full the message is copied to the mailbox and the sending thread continues if  the mailbox is full the sending thread has four options  wait indefinitely until there is room in the mailbox  wait at most n milliseconds  do not wait at all but rather return immediately  temporarily cache a message one message can be given to the operating  system to keep even though the mailbox to which that message is being  sent is full when the message can be put in the mailbox a message is  sent back to the sender only one such message to a full mailbox can be  pending at any time for a given sending thread  the final option is meant for server tasks such as a line printer driver after  finishing a request such tasks may need to send a one time reply to the task  that had requested service but they must also continue with other service  requests even if the reply mailbox for a client is full  the receive operation must specify the mailbox or mailbox set from which a  message is to be received a mailbox set is a collection of mailboxes as declared  by the task which can be grouped together and treated as one mailbox for the  purposes of the task threads in a task can receive only from a mailbox or  mailbox set for which the task has receive access a porlstatus system  call returns the number of messages in a given mailbox the receive operation  attempts to receive from any mailbox in a mailbox set or a specific   named mailbox if no message is waiting to be received the receiving thread  can either wait at most n milliseconds or not wait at all  the mach system was especially designed for distributed systems which  we discuss in chapters through but mach is also suitable for single\\xad processor systems as evidenced by its inclusion in the mac os x system the  major problem with message systems has generally been poor performance  caused by double copying of messages the message is copied first from  the sender to the mailbox and then from the mailbox to the receiver the  mach message system attempts to avoid double copy operations by using  virtual memory management techniques chapter essentially mach maps  the address space containing the sender s message into the receiver s address  space the message itself is never actually copied this message management  technique provides a large performance boost but works for only intrasystem  messages the mach operating system is discussed in an extra chapter posted  on our website     an example windows xp  the windows xp operating system is an example of modern design that  employs modularity to increase functionality and decrease the time needed  to implement new features windows xp provides support for multiple  operating environments or subsystems with which application programs  communicate via a n essage passing mechanism the application programs  can be considered clients of the windows xp subsystem server  the message passing facility in windows xp is called the  facility the lpc in windows xp communicates between two  processes on the same machine it is similar to the standard rpc mechanism that  is widely used but it is optimized for and specific to windows xp like mach  windows xp uses a port object to establish and maintain a connection between  two processes every client that calls a subsystem needs a communication  channet which is provided by a port object and is never inherited windows  xp uses two types of ports connection ports and communication ports they  are really the same but are given different names according to how they are  used  cmmection ports are named objects and are visible to all processes they  give applications a way to set up communication channels chapter the  communication works as follows  the client opens a handle to the subsystem s connection port object  the client sends a cmmection request  the server creates two private conimunication ports and returns the handle  to one of them to the client  the client and server use the corresponding port handle to send messages  or callbacks and to listen for replies  windows xp uses two types of rnessage passing techniques over a port that  the client specifies when it establishes the channel the simplest which is used  for small messages uses the port s message queue as intermediate storage and  copies the message from one process to the other under this method messages  of up to bytes can be sent  if a client needs to send a larger message it passes the message through  a which sets up a region of shared memory the client has to  decide when it sets up the channel whether or not it will need to send a large  message if the client determines that it does want to send large messages it  asks for a section object to be created similarly if the server decides that replies  will be large it creates a section object so that the section object can be used  a small message is sent that contains a pointer and size information about the  section object this method is more complicated than the first method but it  avoids data copying in both cases a callback mechanism can be used when  either the client or the server cannot respond immediately to a request the  callback mechanism allows them to perform asynchronous message handling  the structure of local procedure calls in windows xp is shown in figure  it is important to note that the lpc facility in windows xp is not part of  the win api and hence is not visible to the application programmer rather  applications using the win api invoke standard remote procedure calls   chapter   client server  connection  request j connection i handle  i port i  handle i client i   communication port  i  i server i handle  communication port i  shared  section object    bytes  figure local procedure calls in windows xp  when the rpc is being invoked on a process on the same system the rpc is  indirectly handled through a local procedure call lpcs are also used in a few  other functions that are part of the win api  in section we described how processes can communicate using shared  memory and message passing these techniques can be used for communica\\xad tion in client server systems section  as well in this section we explore  three other strategies for communication ir client server systems sockets  remote procedure calls rpcs and pipes   sockets  a is defined as an endpoint for communication a pair of processes  communicating over a network employ a pair of sockets one for each process  a socket is identified by an ip address concatenated with a port number in  general sockets use a client server architecture the server waits for incoming  client requests by listening to a specified port once a request is received the  server accepts a cmmection from the client socket to complete the comection  servers implementing specific services such as telnet ftp and i htp listen  to well known ports a telnet server listens to port an ftp server listens to  port and a web or http server listens to port all ports below are  considered ·well known we can use them to implement standard services  when a client process initiates a request for a connection it is assigned  a port by its host computer this port is some arbitrary number greater than   for example if a client on host x with ip address  wishes to  establish a connection with a web server which is listening on port at  address  host x may be assigned port the connection will  consist of a pair of sockets   on host x and   on the web server this situation is illustrated in figure the packets  traveling between the hosts are delivered to the appropriate process based on  the destination port number    host x   i   socket   i   web server   i  i  socket   i  i   figure communication using sockets  all com ections must be unique therefore if another process also on host  x wished to establish another connection with the same web server it would be  assigned a port number greater than and not equal to this ensures  that all com ections consist of a unique pair of sockets  although most program examples in this text use c we will illustrate  sockets using java as it provides a much easier interface to sockets and has a  rich library for networking utilities those interested in socket programming  inc or c should consult the bibliographical notes at the end of the chapter  java provides three different types of sockets  are implemented with the socket class  use the datagram socket class finally the mul ticastsocket class is a subclass  of the datagram socket class a multicast socket allows data to be sent to  multiple recipients  our example describes a date server that uses connection oriented tcp  sockets the operation allows clients to request the current date and time from  the server the server listens to port although the port could have any  arbitrary number greater than when a cmmection is received the server  returns the date and time to the client  the date server is shown in figure the server creates a serversocket  that specifies it will listen to port the server then begins listening to the  port with the accept method the server blocks on the accept method  waiting for a client to request a com ection when a connection request is  received accept returns a socket that the server can use to communicate  with the client  the details of how the server communicates with the socket are as follows  the server first establishes a printwri ter objectthatitwill use to communicate  with the client a printwri ter object allows the server to write to the socket  using the routine print and println methods for output the server  process sends the date to the client calling the method println  once it  has written the date to the socket the server closes the socket to the client and  resumes listening for more requests  a client communicates with the server by creating a socket and connecting  to the port on which the server is listening we implement such a client in the   chapter  import java net  import java io  public class dateserver     public static void main string args  try   serversocket sock new serversocket  ii now listen for connections  while true

such as www westminstercollege eduf can be used as well  communication using sockets although common and efficient is con\\xad sidered a low level form of communication between distributed processes  one reason is that sockets allow only an unstructured stream of bytes to be  exchanged between the communicating threads it is the responsibility of the  client or server application to impose a structure on the data in the next two  subsectionsf we look at two higher level methods of communication remote  procedure calls rpcs and pipes    import java net  import java io  public class

err println ioe    figure date client   remote procedure calls  one of the most common forms of remote service is the rpc paradigm which  we discussed briefly in section  the rpc was designed as a way to  abstract the procedure call mechanism for use between systems with network  connections it is similar in many respects to the ipc mechanism described in  section and it is usually built on top of such a system here however  because we are dealing with an environment in which the processes are  executing on separate systems we must use a message based communication  scheme to provide remote service in contrast to the ipc facility the messages  exchanged in rpc communication are well structured and are thus no longer  just packets of data each message is addressed to an rpc daemon listening to  a port on the remote system and each contains an identifier of the ftmction  to execute and the parameters to pass to that function the function is then  executed as requested and any output is sent back to the requester in a separate  message  a port is simply a number included at the start of a message packet whereas  a system normally has one network address it can have many ports within  that address to differentiate the many network services it supports if a rencote  process needs a service it addresses a message to the proper port for instance   chapter  if a system wished to allow other systems to be able to list its current users it  would have a daemon supporting such an rpc attached to a port say port   any remote system could obtain the needed information that is the list  of current users by sending an rpc message to port oil the server the  data would be received in a reply message  the semantics of rpcs allow a client to invoke a procedure on a remote  host as it would invoke a procedure locally the rpc system hides the details  that allow comnmnication to take place by providing a on the client side  typically a separate stub exists for each separate remote procedure when the  client invokes a remote procedure the rpc system calls the appropriate stub  passing it the parameters provided to the remote procedure this stub locates  the port on the server and marshals the parameters parameter marshalling  involves packaging the parameters into a form that can be transmitted over  a network the stub then transmits a message to the server using message  passing a similar stub on the server side receives this message and invokes  the procedure on the server if necessary return values are passed back to the  client using the same teclu ique  one issue that must be dealt with concerns differences in data representa\\xad tion on the client and server machines consider the representation of bit  integers some systems known as big endian store the most significant byte  first while other systems known as little endian store the least significant  byte first neither order is better per se rather the choice is arbitrary within  a computer architecture to resolve differences like this many rpc systems  define a machine independent representation of data one such representation  is known as data on the client side parameter  marshalling involves converting the machine dependent data into xdr before  they are sent to the server on the server side the xdr data are m marshalled  and converted to the machine dependent representation for the server  another important issue involves the semantics of a call whereas local  procedure calls fail only under extreme circumstances rpcs can fait or be  duplicated and executed more than once as a result of common network  errors one way to address this problem is for the operating system to ensure  that messages are acted on exactly once rather than at most once most local  procedure calls have the exactly once functionality but it is more difficult to  implement  first consider at most once this semantic can be implemented by  attaching a timestamp to each message the server must keep a history of  all the timestamps of messages it has already processed or a history large  enough to ensure that repeated messages are detected incoming messages  that have a timestamp already in the history are ignored the client can then  send a message one or more times and be assured that it only executes once   generation of these timestamps is discussed in section   for exactly once we need to remove the risk that the server will never  receive the reqliest to accomplish this the server must implement the at  most once protocol described above but must also acknowledge to the client  that the rpc call was received and executed these ack messages are common  throughout networking the client must resend each rpc call periodically until  it receives the ack for that call  another important issue concerns the communication between a server  and a client with standard procedure calls some form of binding takes place    during link load or execution time chapter so that a procedure call s name  is replaced by the memory address of the procedure call the rpc scheme  requires a similar binding of the client and the server port but how does a client  know the port numbers on the server neither system has full information  about the other because they do not share memory  two approaches are common first the binding information may be  predetermined in the form of fixed port addresses at compile time an rpc  call has a fixed port number associated with it once a program is compiled  the server cannot change the port number of the requested service second  binding can be done dynamically by a rendezvous mechanism an  operating system provides a rendezvous also called a daemon  on a fixed rpc port a client then sends a message containing the name of  the rpc to the rendezvous daemon requesting the port address of the rpc it  needs to execute the port number is returned and the rpc calls can be sent  to that port until the process terminates or the server crashes this method  requires the extra overhead of the initial request but is more flexible than the  first approach figure shows a sample interaction  client  kejyt c sends

execution of a remote procedure call rpc   chapter  the rpc scheme is useful in implementing a distriblited file system   chapter such a system can be implemented as a set of rpc daemons  and clients the messages are addressed to the distributed file system port on a  server on which a file operation is to take place the message contains the disk  operation to be performed the disk operation might be read write rename  delete or status corresponding to the usual file related system calls the  return message contains any data resulting from that call which is executed by  the dfs daemon on behalf of the client for instance a message might contain  a request to transfer a whole file to a client or be limited to a simple block  request in the latter case several such requests may be needed if a whole file  is to be transferred   pipes  a acts as a conduit allowin g two processes to communicate pipes were  one of the first ipc mechanisms in early unix systems and typically provide one  of the simpler ways for processes to communicate with one another although  they also have some limitations in implementing a pipe four issues must be  considered  does the pipe allow unidirectional communication or bidirectional com\\xad munication  if two way communication is allowed is it half duplex data can travel  only one way at a time or full duplex data can travel in both directions  at the same time  must a relationship such as parent child exist between the commlmicat\\xad ing processes  can the pipes communicate over a network or must the communicating  processes reside on the same machine  in the following sections we explore two common types of pipes used on both  unix and windows systems   ordinary pipes  ordinary pipes allow two processes to communicate in standard producer  consumer fashion the producer writes to one end of the the  and the consumer reads from the other end the a result ordinary  pipes are unidirectional allowing only one way communication if two way  communication is required two pipes must be used with each pipe sending  data in a different direction we next illustrate constructing ordinary pipes  on both unix and windows systems in both program examples one process  writes the message greetings to the pipe while the other process reads this  message front the pipe  on unix systems ordinary pipes are constructed using the function  pipe int fd   this function creates a pipe that is accessed through the int fd file  descriptors fd is the read end of the pipe and fd is the write end    parent child  fd o fd fd o fd u pip e ou  figure file descriptors for an ordinary pipe  unix treats a pipe as a special type of file thus pipes can be accessed using  ordinary read and write system calls  an ordinary pipe cannot be accessed from outside the process that creates  it thus typically a parent process creates a pipe and uses it to comnmnicate  with a child process it creates via fork recall from section that a child  process inherits open files from its parent since a pipe is a special type of file  the child inherits the pipe from its parent process figure illustrates the  relationship of the file descriptor fd to the parent and child processes  in the unix progranc shown in figure the parent process creates a  pipe and then sends a fork call creating the child process what occurs after  the fork call depends on how the data are to flow through the pipe in this  instance the parent writes to the pipe and the child reads from it it is important  to notice that both the parent process and the child process initially close their  unused ends of the pipe although the program shown in figure does not  require this action it is an important step to ensure that a process reading from  the pipe can detect end of file read returns when the writer has closed  its end of the pipe   include sys types h   include stdio h   include string h   include unistd h   define buffer size

and  employ parent child relationships between the communicating processes  in addition reading and writing to the pipe can be accomplished with the  ordinary readfile and wri tefile functions the win api for creating  pipes is the createpi pe function which is passed four parameters separate  handles for reading and writing to the pipe as well as an instance of  the startupinfo structure which is

the pipe in bytes  may be specified  figure illustrates a parent process creating an anonymous pipe for  communicating with its child unlike unix systems in which a child process  automatically inherits a pipe created by its parent windows requires the  programmer to specify which attributes the child process will inherit this is  accomplished by first initializing the security attributes structure to allow  handles to be inherited and then redirecting the child process s handles for  standard input or standard output to the read or write handle of the pipe  since the child will be reading from the pipe the parent must redirect the  child s standard input to the read handle of the pipe furthermore as the pipes  are half duplex it is necessary to prohibit the child from inheriting the write  end of the pipe creating the child process is similar to the program in figure   except that the fifth parameter is set to true indicating that the child  process is to inherit designated handles from its parent before writing to the  pipe the parent first closes its unused read end of the pipe the child process  that reads from the pipe is shown in figure before reading from the pipe  this program obtains the read handle to the pipe by invoking getstdhandle   note that ordinary pipes require a parent child relationship between the  communicating processes on both unix and windows systems this means  that these pipes can be used only for communication between processes on the  same machine   named pipes  ordinary pipes provide a simple communication mechanism between a pair  of processes however ordinary pipes exist only while the processes are  communicating with one another on both unix and windows systems once  the processes have finished communicating

continue to exist after communicating  processes have finished both unix and windows systems support named  pipes although the details of implementation vary greatly next we explore  named pipes in each of these systems  named pipes are referred to as fifos in unix systems once created they  appear as typical files in the file system a fifo is created with the mkfifo  system call and manipulated with the ordinary open read write  and close system calls it will contirme to exist m til it is explicitly deleted  from the file system although fifos allow bidirectional communication only  half duplex transmission is permitted if data must travel in both directions  two fifos are typically used additionally the communicating processes must  reside on the same machine sockets section  must be used if intermachine  communication is required  named pipes on windows systems provide a richer communication mech\\xad anism than their unix counterparts full duplex communication is allowed  and the communicating processes may reside on either the same or different  machines additionally only byte oriented data may be transmitted across a  unix ftfo whereas windows systems allow either byte or message oriented  data named pipes are created with the createnamedpipe function and a  client can connect to a named pipe using connectnamedpipe  communi\\xad cation over the named pipe can be accomplished using the readfile and  wri tefile functions   chapter   pipes in practice  pipes are used quite often in the unix command line environment for  situations in which the output of one command serves as input to the  second for example the unix ls command produces a directory listing  for especially long directory listings the output may scroll through several  screens the command more manages output by displaying only one screen  of output at a time the user must press the space bar to move from one screen  to the next setting up a pipe between the ls and more commands which  are running as individual processes allows the output of ls to be delivered  as the input to moref enabling the user to display a large directory listing a  screen at a time a pipe can be constructed on the command line using the i  character the complete command is  ls i more  in this scenario the ls corrmand serves as the producer and its output is  consumed by the more command  windows systems provide a more command for the dos shell with  functionality similar to that of its unix cmmterpart the dos shell also uses  the i character for establishing a pipe the only difference is that to get a  directory listing dos uses the dir command rather than ls the equivalent  command in dos to what is shown above is  dir i more  a process is a program in execution as a process executes it changes state the  state of a process is defined by that process s current activity each process may  be in one of the following states new readyf running waiting or terminated  each process is represented in the operating system by its own process control  block pcb  a process when it is not executing is placed in some waiting queue there  are two major classes of queues in an operating system i request queuecc  and the ready queue the ready queue contains all the processes that are ready  to execute and are waiting for the cpu each process is represented by a pcbf  and the pcbs can be linked together to form a ready queue long term job  scheduling is the selection of processes that will be allowed to contend for  the cpu normally long term scheduling is heavily influenced by resource\\xad allocation considerations especially memory management short term cpu  scheduling is the selection of one process from the ready queue  operating systems must provide a mechanism for parent processes to  create new child processes the parent may wait for its children to terminate  before proceeding or the parent and children may execute concurrently there  are several reasons for allowing concurrent execution information sharing  computation speedup modularity and convenience    the processes executing in the operating system may be either independent  processes or cooperating processes cooperating processes require an interpro\\xad cess communication mechanisnc to commlmicate with each other principally  communication is achieved through two schemes shared mernory and mes\\xad sage passing the shared memory method requires communicating processes  to share some variables the processes are expected to exchange information  through the use of these shared variables in a shared memory system the  responsibility for providing communication rests with the application pro\\xad grammers the operating system needs to provide only the shared memory  the message passing method allows the processes to exchange messages  the responsibility for providing communication may rest with the operating  system itself these two schemes are not mutually exclusive and can be used  simultaneously within a single operating system  communication in client server systems may use sockets  remote  procedure calls rpcs or pipes a socket is defined as an endpoint for  communication a connection between a pair of applications consists of a  pair of sockets one at each end of the communication chamcel rpcs are  another form of distributed commlmication an rpc occurs when a process   or thread calls a procedure on a remote application ordinary pipes allow  communication between parent and child processes while named pipes permit  unrelated processes to communicate with one another   what are the benefits and the disadvantages of each of the following  consider both the system level and the programmer level  a synchronous and asynchronous commmucation  b automatic and explicit buffering  c send by copy and send by reference  d fixed sized and variable sized messages   consider the rpc mechanism describe the undesirable consequences  that could arise from not enforcing either the at most once or exactly  once semantic describe possible uses for a mechanism that has neither  of these guarantees   with respect to the rpc mechanism consider the exactly once semantic  does the algorithm for implementing this semantic execute correctly  even if the ack message back to the client is lost due to a network  problem describe the sequence of messages and discuss whether   exactly once is still preserved   palm os provides no means of concurrent processing discuss three  major complications that concurrent processing adds to an operating  system   chapter   describe

figure to obtain process informa\\xad tion for the unix or linux system use the command ps ael use the  command man ps to get more information about the ps command on  windows systems you will have to use the task manager   give an example of a situation in which ordinary pipes are more suitable  than named pipes and an example of a situation in which named pipes  are more suitable than ordinary pipes   describe the differences among short term medium term and long\\xad term scheduling   including the initial parent process how many processes are created by  the program shown in figure   using the program in figure identify the values of pid at lines a b  c and d assume that the actual pids of the parent and child are  and respectively   include stdio h   include unistd h  int main

child processes have their own copies  of the dataf it will be necessary for the child to output the sequence  have the parent invoke the wait call to wait for the child process to  complete before exiting the program perform necessary error checking  to ensure that a non negative number is passed on the command  line   repeat the preceding exercisef this time using the createprocess  function in the win api in this instancef you will need to specify  a separate program to be invoked from createprocess  it is this  separate program that will run as a child process outputting the  fibonacci sequence perform necessary error checking to ensure that  a non negative number is passed on the command line   modify the date server shown in figure so that it delivers random  jokes rather than the current date allow the jokes to contain multiple  lines the date client shown in figure can be used to read the  multi line jokes returned by the joke server   an echo server echoes back whatever it receives from a client for  examplef if a client sends the server the string hello there the server  will respond with the exact data it received from the client that isf  hello there    write an echo server using the java networking api described in  section  this server will wait for a client connection using the  accept method when a client connection is received the server will  loop perfonning the following steps  read data from the socket into a buffer  write the contents of the buffer back to the client  the server will break out of the loop only when it has determined that  the client has closed the connection  the server shown in figure uses the java io bufferedreader  class bufferedreader extends the java io reader class which is  used for reading character streams however the echo server cannot  guarantee that it will read characters from clients it may receive binary  data as well the class java io input stream deals with data at the byte  level rather than the character level thus this echo server must use an  object that extends java io inputstrearn the read method in the  java io inputstrearn class returns when the client has closed its  end of the socket connection   in exercise the child process must output the fibonacci sequence  since the parent and child have their own copies of the data another  approach to designing this program is to establish a shared memory  segment between the parent and child processes this technique allows  the child to write the contents of the fibonacci sequence to the shared\\xad memory segment and has the parent output the sequence when the child  completes because the memory is shared any changes the child makes  will be reflected in the parent process as well  this program will be structured using posix shared memory  as described in section  the program first requires creating the  data structure for the shared memory segment this is most easily  accomplished using a struct this data structure will contain two items   a fixed sized array of size malsequence that will hold the fibonacci  values and the size of the sequence the child process is to generate\\xad sequence size where sequence size  malsequence these items  can be represented in a struct as follows   define max sequence  typedef struct  long fib sequence max sequence  int sequence size   shared data  the parent process will progress thmugh the following steps  a accept the parameter passed on the command line and perform  error checking to ensure that the parameter is  max sequence  b create a shared memory segment of size shared data  c attach the shared memory segment to its address space   chapter  d set the value of sequence size to the parameter on the command  line  e fork the child process and invoke the wait systen call to wait  for the child to finish  f output the value of the fibonacci sequence in the shared memory  segment  g detach and remove the shared memory segment  because the child process is a copy of the parent the shared memory  region will be attached to the child s address space as well as the  parent s the child process will then write the fibonacci sequence to  shared memory and finally will detach the segment  one issue of concern with cooperating processes involves synchro\\xad nization issues in this exercise the parent and child processes must be  synchronized so that the parent does not output the fibonacci sequence  until the child finishes generating the sequence these two processes  will be synchronized using the wait system call the parent process  will invoke wait  which will cause it to be suspended until the child  process exits   design a program using ordinary pipes in which one process sends a  string message to a second process and the second process reverses  the case of each character in the message and sends it back to the first  process for example if the first process sends the message hi there  the second process will return hi there this will require using two  pipes one for sending the original message from the first to the second  process and the other for sending the modified message from the second  back to the first process you may write this program using either unix  or windows pipes   design a file copying program named filecopy using ordinary pipes  this program will be passed two parameters the first is the name of  the file to be copied and the second is the name of the copied file the  program will then create an ordinary pipe and write the contents of the  file to be copied to the pipe the child process will read this file from  the pipe and write it to the destination file for example if we invoke  the program as follows  filecopy input txt copy txt  the file input txt will be written to the pipe the child process will  read the contents of this file and write it to the destination file copy txt  you may write this program using either unix or windows pipes   most unix and linux systems provide the ipcs command this com\\xad mand lists the status of various posix interprocess communication  mechanisms including shared memory segments much of the informa\\xad tion for the command comes from the data structure struct shmid ds    which is available in the usr include sys shm h file some of the  fields in this structure include  int shm segsz size of the shared memory segment  short shm nattch number of attaches to the shared memory  segment  struct ipc perm shm perm permission structure of the shared\\xad memory segment  the struct ipc perm data structure which is available in the file   usr include sys ipc h contains the fields  unsigned short uid identifier of the user of the shared memory  segment  unsigned short mode permission modes  key t key on linux systems  key user specified key identifier  the permission modes are set according to how the shared memory  segment is established with the shmget system call permissions are  identified according to the following  write permission of owner   read permission of group   write permission of group   read permission of world   write permissionof world  permissions can be accessed by using the bitwise and operator  for example if the statement mode evaluates to true the  permission mode gives read permission to the owner of the shared\\xad memory segment  a shared memory segment can be identified according to a user\\xad specified key or according to the integer value returned from the  shmget system call which represents the integer identifier of the  shared memory segment created the shm ds structure for a given  integer segment identifier can be obtained with the following shmctl  system call  i identifier of the shared memory segment  int segment id  shm ds shmbuffer  shmctl segment id ipc stat shmbuffer   chapter  if successful shmctl returns otherwise it returns indicating an  error condition the global variable errno can be accessed to determine  the error condition  write a c program that is passed an identifier for a shared memory  segment this program will invoke the shmctl function to obtain  its shm ds structure it will then output the following values of the  shared memory

external processes and a central  process the project can be completed on systems that support posix  message passing such as unix linux and mac os x  part overview  four external processes will communicate temperatures to a central  process which in turn will reply with its own temperature and will  indicate whether the entire system has stabilized each process will  receive its initial temperature upon creation and will recalculate a new  temperature according to two formulas  new external temp   mytemp   centraltemp i  new central temp   centraltemp four temps received from external processes i  initially each external process will send its temperature to the mailbox  for the central process if all four temperatures are exactly the same as  those sent by the four processes during the last iteration the system  has stabilized in this case the central process will notify each external  process that it is now finished along with the central process itself  and each process will output the final stabilized temperature if the  system has not yet become stable the central process will send its new  temperature to the mailbox for each of the outer processes and await  their replies the processes will continue to run until the temperature  has stabilized    part the message passing system  processes can exchange messages by using four system calls msgget   msgsnd  msgrcv  and msgctl  the msgget function converts  a mailbox name to a message queue id msqid a mailbox name  is an externally known message queue name that is shared among  the cooperating processes msqid the internal identifier returned by  msgget  must be passed to all subsequent system calls using this  message queue to facilitate interprocess communication a typical  invocation of msgget is seen below  msqid msgget i ipc creat  the first parameter is the name of the mailbox and the second parameter  instructs the operating system to create the message queue if it does not  already exist with read and write privileges only for processes with the  same user id as this process if a message queue already exists for this  mailbox name msgget returns the msqid of the existing mailbox to  avoid attaching to an existing message queue a process can first attempt  to attach to the mailbox by omitting ipc creat and then checking the  return value from msgget  if msq id is negative an error has occurred  during the system calt and the globally accessible variable errno can be  consulted to determine whether the error occurred because the message  queue already exists or for some other reason if the process determines  that the mailbox does not currently exist it can then create it by including  ipc creat for the current project this strategy should not be necessary  if students are using standalone pcs or are assigned unique ranges of  mailbox names by the instructor  once a valid msqid has been established a process can begin to  use msgsnd to send messages and msgrcv to receive messages  the messages being sent and received are similar in format to those  described in section  as they include a fixed length portion at the  beginning followed by a variable length portion obviously the senders  and receivers must agree on the format of the messages being exchanged  since the operating system specifies one field in the fixed length portion  of every message format and at least one piece of information will  be sent to the receiving process it is logical to create a data aggregate  for each type of message using a struct the first field of any such  struct must be a long and it will contain the priority of the message   this project does not use this functionality we recommend that you  simply make the first field in every message equal to the same integral  value such as other fields in the messages contain the information  to be shared between the communicating processes three additional  fields are recommended  the temperature being sent  the process  number of the external process sending the message for the central  process and a flag that is set to but that the central process will  set to when it notices stability a recommended struct appears as  follows   chapter  struct  long priority  int temp  int pid  int stable   msgp  assuming the msqid has been established examples of msgsnd and  msgrcv appear as such  int stat msqid  stat msgsnd msqid msgp  sizeof msgp sizeof long   stat msgrcv msqid msgp  sizeof msgp sizeof long   the first parameter in both system calls must be a valid msq id otherwise  a negative value is returned both functions return the number of  bytes sent or received upon successful completion of the operation  the second parameter is the address of where to find or store the  message to be sent or received followed by the number of information  bytes to be sent or received the final parameter of indicates that the  operations will be synchronous and that the sender will block if the  message queue is full ipc nowait would be used if asynchronous or  nonblocking operations were desired each individual message queue  can hold a maximum number of messages or bytes so it is possible  for the queue to become filled which is one reason a sender may block  when attempting to transmit a message the that appears before this  final parameter in msgrcv indicates the minimum priority level of  the messages the process wishes to receive the receiver will wait until  a message of that priority or higher is sent to the msqid if this is a  synchronous operation  once a process is finished using a message queue it must be  removed so that the mailbox can be reused by other processes unless  it is removed the message queue and any messages that have not yet  been received will remain in the storage space that has been provided  for this mailbox by the kernel to remove the message queue and delete  any unread messages therein it is necessary to invoke msgctl  as  follows  struct msgid ds dummyparam  status msgctl msqid ipc rmid dummyparam  the third parameter is necessary because this function requires it but it  is used only if it the programmer wishes to collect some statistics about  the usage of the message queue this is accomplished by substituting  ipc stat as the second parameter  all programs should include the following three header files which  are found in usr include sys ipc h types h and msg h one  possibly confusing artifact of the message queue implementation bears    mentioning at this point after a mailbox is removed via msgctl any  subsequent attempts to create another mailbox with that same name  using msgget will typically generate a different msqid  part creating the processes  each external process as well as the central server will create its own  mailbox with the name x i where i is a numeric identifier of the  external process or zero for the central process thus if x were  then the central process would receive messages in the mailbox named   and it would send its replies to mailboxes outer process  would receive in mailbox and would send to mailbox and so forth  thus each external process will attach to two mailboxes and the central  process will attach to five if each process specifies ipc creat when  invoking msgget  the first process that invokes msgget actually  creates the mailbox subsequent calls to msgget attach to the existing  mailbox the protocol for removal should be that the mailbox message  queue that each process is listening to should be the only one it removes   via msgctl   each external process will be uniquely identified by a command line  parameter the first parameter to each external process will be its initial  temperature and the second parameter will be its unique number   or the central server will be passed one parameter its initial  temperature assuming the executable name of the external process is  external and the central server is central invoking all five processes  will be done as follows   external    external    external    external    central  part implementation hints  it might be best to start by sending one message successfully from  the central process to a single outer process and vice versa before  trying to write all the code to solve this problem it is also wise to  check all the return values from the four message queue system calls  for possible failed requests and to output a message to the screen after  each one successfully completes the message should indicate what was  accomplished and by whom for instance mailbox has been created  by outer process  message received by central process from external  process and so forth these messages can be removed or commented  out after the problem is solved processes should also verify that they  were passed the correct number of command line parameters via the  argc parameter in main  finally extraneous messages residing in  a queue can cause a collection of cooperating processes that function  correctly to appear erroneous for that reason it is wise to remove all  mailboxes relevant to this project to ensure that mailboxes are empty  before the processes begin the easiest way to do this is to use the   chapter  ipcs command to list all message queues and the ipcrm command to  remove existing message queues the ipcs command lists the msqid of  all message queues on the system use ipcrm to remove message queues  according to their msqid for example if msqid appears with the  output of ipcs it can be deleted with the following command  ipcrm q  interprocess

respectively   chapter  the process model introduced in chapter assumed that a process was an  executing program with a single thread of control most modern operating  systems now provide features enabling a process to contain multiple threads of  control this chapter introduces many concepts associated with multithreaded  computer systems including a discussion of the apis for the pthreads win  and java thread libraries we look at many issues related to multithreaded  programming and its effect on the design of operating systems finally we  explore how the windows xp and linux operating systems support threads at  the kernel level  to introduce the notion of a thread a fundamental unit of cpu utilization  that forms the basis of multithreaded computer systems  to discuss the apis for the pthreads win and java thread libraries  to examine issues related to multithreaded programming  a thread is a basic unit of cpu utilization it comprises a thread id a program  counter a register set and a stack it shares with other threads belonging  to the same process its code section data section and other operating system  resources such as open files and signals a traditional or heavrvveighl process  has a single thread of control if a process has multiple threads of control it  can perform more than one task at a time figure illustrates the difference  between a traditional process and a process   motivation  many software packages that run on modern desktop pcs are multithreaded  an application typically is implemented as a separate process with several  threads of control a web browser might have one thread display images or     chapter  thread  single threaded process multithreaded process  figure single threaded and multithreaded processes  text while another thread retrieves data from the network for example a  word processor may have a thread for displaying graphics another thread  for responding to keystrokes from the user and a third thread for performing  spelling and grammar checking in the background  in certain situations a single application may be required to perform  several similar tasks for example a web server accepts client requests for  web pages images sound and so forth a busy web server may have several   perhaps thousands of clients concurrently accessing it if the web server ran  as a traditional single tlu·eaded process it would be able to service only one  client at a time artd a client might have to wait a very long time for its request  to be serviced  one solution is to have the server run as a single process that accepts  requests when the server receives a request it creates a separate process  to service that request in fact this process creation method was in common  use before threads became popular process creation is time consuming and  resource intensive however if the new process will perform the same tasks as  the existing process why incur all that overhead it is generally more efficient  to use one process that contains multiple threads if the web server process  is multithreaded the server will create a separate thread that listens for client  requests when a request is made rather than creating another process the  server will create a new thread to service the request and resume listening for  additional requests this is illustrated in figure  threads also play a vital role in remote procedure call rpc systems recall  from chapter that rpcs allow interprocess communication by providing a  communication mechanism similar to ordinary function or procedure calls  typically rpc servers are multithreaded when a server receives a message it  services the message using a separate thread this allows the server to service  several concurrent requests  finally most operating system kernels are now multithreaded several  threads operate in the kernel and each thread performs a specific task such  client request   create new  thread to service  the request  • thread     r server   resume listening  for additional  client requests  figure multithreaded server architecture  as managing devices or interrupt handling for examplef solaris creates a set  of threads in the kernel specifically for interrupt handling linux uses a kernel  thread for managing the amount of free memory in the system   benefits  the benefits of multithreaded programming can be broken down into four  major categories  responsiveness multithreading an interactive application may allow a  program to continue running even if part of it is blocked or is performing  a lengthy operation thereby increasing responsiveness to the user for  instancef a multithreaded web browser could allow user interaction in  one thread while an image was being loaded in another thread  resource sharing processes may only share resources through tech\\xad niques such as shared memory or message passing such techniques must  be explicitly arranged by the programmer however threads share the  memory and the resources of the process to which they belong by default  the benefit of sharing code and data is that it allows an application to  have several different threads of activity within the same address space   economy allocating memory and resources for process creation is costly  because threads share the resources of the process to which they belong  it is more economical to create and context switch threads empirically  gauging the difference in overhead can be difficult but in general it is  much more time consuming to create and manage processes than threads  in solarisf for example creating a process is about thirty times slower than  is creating a thread and context switching is about five times slower  scalability the benefits of multithreading can be greatly increased in a  multiprocessor architecture where threads may be running in parallel  on different processors a single threaded process can only run on one  processor regardless how many are available multithreading on a multi\\xad cpu machine increases parallelism we explore this issue further in the  following section   chapter  time  figure concurrent execution on a single core system   multicore programming  a recent trend in system design has been to place multiple computing cores on  a single chip where each core appears as a separate processor to the operating  system section  multithreaded programming provides a mechanism  for more efficient use of multiple cores and improved concurrency consider  an application with four threads on a system with a single computing core  concurrency merely means that the execution of the threads will be interleaved  over time figure  as the processing core is capable of executing only one  thread at a time on a system with multiple cores however concurrency means  that the threads can run in parallel as the system can assign a separate thread  to each core figure   the trend towards multicore systems has placed pressure on system  designers as well as application programmers to make better use of the multiple  computing cores designers of operating systems must write scheduling  algorithms that use multiple processing cores to allow the parallel execution  shown in figure for application programmers the challenge is to modify  existing programs as well as design new programs that are multithreaded to  take advantage of multicore systems in general five areas present challenges  in programming for multicore systems  dividing activities this involves examining applications to find areas  that can be divided into separate concurrent tasks and thus can run in  parallel on individual cores  balance while identifying tasks that can run in parallel programmers  must also ensure that the tasks perform equal work of equal value in  some instances a certain task may not contribute as much value to the  overall process as other tasks using a separate execution core to run that  task may not be worth the cost  data splitting just as applications are divided into separate tasks the  data accessed and manipulated by the tasks must be divided to run on  separate cores  core l t i t t t i ti  core i t t t i tz  time  figure parallel execution on a multicore system     data dependency the data accessed by the tasks must be examined  for dependencies between two or more tasks in instances where one  task depends on data from another programmers must ensure that  the execution of the tasks is synchronized to accommodate the data  dependency we examine such strategies in chapter  testing and debugging when a program is running in parallel on  multiple cores there are many different execution paths testing and  debugging such concurrent programs is inherently more difficult than  testing and debugging single threaded applications  because of these challenges many software developers argue that the advent of  multicore systems will require an entirely new approach to designing software  systems in the future  our discussion so far has treated threads in a generic sense however support  for threads may be provided either at the user level for or by the  kernel for threads user threads are supported above the kernel and  are managed without kernel support whereas kernel threads are supported  and managed directly by the operating system virtually all contemporary  operating systems including wiridows xp linux mac os x solaris and  tru unix formerly digital unix support kernel threads  ultimately a relationship must exist between user threads and kernel  threads in this section we look at three common ways of establishing such a  relationship   many to one model  the many to one model figure maps many user level threads to one  kernel thread thread management is done by the thread library in user  figure many to one model   chapter   user thread  figure one to one model  space so it is efficient but the entire process will block if a thread makes a  blocking system call also because only one thread can access the kernel at a  time multiple threads are unable to nm in parallel on multiprocessors   a thread library available for solaris uses this modet as does gnu   one to one model  the one to one model figure maps each user thread to a kernel thread it  provides more concurrency than the many to one model by allowing another  thread to run when a thread makes a blocking system call it also allows  multiple threads to run in parallel on multiprocessors the only drawback to  this model is that creating a user thread requires creating the corresponding  kernel thread because the overhead of creating kernel threads can burden the  performance of an application most implementations of this model restrict the  number of threads supported by the system linux along with the family of  windows operating systems implement the one to one model   many to many model  the many to many model figure multiplexes many user level threads to  a smaller or equal number of kernel threads the number of kernel threads  may be specific to either a particular application or a particular machine an  application may be allocated more kernel threads on a multiprocessor than  on a uniprocessor whereas the many to one model allows the developer to  user thread  k  kernel thread  figure many to many model          i         user thread      kernel thread  figure two level model  create as many user threads as she wishes true concurrency is not gained  because the kernel can schedule only one thread at a time the one to one  model allows for greater concurrency but the developer has to be careful not  to create too many threads within an application and in some instances may  be limited in the number of threads she can create the many to many model  suffers from neither of these shortcomings developers can create as many user  threads as necessary and the corresponding kernel threads can run in parallel  on a multiprocessor also when a thread performs a blocking system call the  kernel can schedule another thread for execution  one popular variation on the many to many model still multiplexes many  user level threads to a smaller or equal number of kernel threads but also allows  a user level thread to be bound to a kernel thread this variation sometimes  referred to as the two level model figure  is supported by operating systems  such as irlx hp ux and tru unix the solaris operating system supported  the two level model in versions older than solaris however beginning with  solaris this system uses the one to one model  a provides the programmer with an api for creating and  managing threads there are two primary ways of implementii g a thread  library the first approach is to provide a library entirely in user space with no  kernel support all code and data structures for the library exist ii user space  this means that invoking a function in the library results in a local function  call in user space and not a system call  the second approach is to implement a kernel level library supported  directly by the operating system in this case code and data structures for  the library exist in kernel space invoking a function in the api for the library  typically results in a system call to the kernel  three main thread libraries are in use today  posix pthreads  win  and java pthreads the threads extension of the posix standard may be  provided as either a user or kernel level library the win thread library  is a kernel level library available on windows systems the java thread api  allows threads to be created and managed directly in java programs however  because in most instances the jvm is running on top of a host operating system   chapter  the java thread api is generally implemented using a thread library available  on the host system this means that on windows systems java threads are  typically implemented using the win api unix and linux systems often use  pthreads  in the remainder of this section we describe basic thread creation using  these three thread libraries as an illustrative example we design a multi\\xad threaded program that performs the summation of a non negative integer in a  separate thread using the well known summation function  n  sum i  i o  for example if n were this function would represent the summation of  integers from to which is each of the three programs will be n m with  the upper bounds of the summation entered on the command line thus if the  user enters the summation of the integer values from to will be output   pthreads  refers to the posix standard ieee lc defining an api for thread  creation and synchronization this is a specification for thread behavim not an  implementation operating system designers may implement the specification in  any way they wish numerous systems implement the pthreads specification  including solaris linux mac os x and tru unix shareware implementations  are available in the public domain for the various windows operating systems  as well  the c program shown in figure demonstrates the basic pthreads api for  constructing a multithreaded program that calculates the summation of a non\\xad negative integer in a separate thread in a pthreads program separate threads  begin execution in a specified function in figure this is the runner  function when this program begins a single thread of control begins in  main  after some initialization main creates a second thread that begins  control in the runner function both threads share the global data sum  let s look more closely at this program all pthreads programs must  include the pthread h header file the statement pthread t tid declares  the identifier for the thread we will create each thread has a set of attributes  including stack size and scheduling information the pthread attr t attr  declaration represents the attributes for the thread we set the attributes in the  function call pthread attr ini t attr because we did not explicitly set  any attributes we use the default attributes provided in chapter we discuss  some of the scheduling attributes provided by the pthreads api a separate  thread is created with the pthread create function call in addition to  passirtg the thread identifier and the attributes for the thread we also pass the  name of the function where the new thread will begin execution in this case  the runner function last we pass the integer parameter that was provided  on the command line argv   at this point the program has two threads the initial or parent thread  in main and the summation or child thread performing the summation     include pthread h   include stdio h  int sum i this data is shared by the thread s i  void runner void param i the thread i  int

function the summation thread will complete when it calls the function  pthread exi t  once the summation thread has returnedf the parent thread  will output the value of the shared data sum   chapter   win threads  the technique for creating threads using the win thread library is similar  to the pthreads technique in several ways we illustrate the win thread  api in the c program shown in figure notice that we must include the  windows h header file when using the win api  just as in the pthreads version shown in figure data shared by the  separate threads in this case sum are declared globally the dword data  type is an unsigned bit integer we also define the summation function  that is to be performed in a separate thread this function is passed a pointer to  a void which win defines as lpvoid the thread performing this function  sets the global data sum to the value of the summation from to the parameter  passed to summation   threads are created in the win api using the createthread function  and just as in pthreads a set of attributes for the thread is passed to this  function these attributes il clude security information the size of the stack  and a flag that can be set to indicate if the thread is to start in a suspended  state in this program we use the default values for these attributes which do  not initially set the thread to a suspended state and instead make it eligible  to be rm by the cpu scheduler once the summation thread is created the  parent must wait for it to complete before outputting the value of sum as  the value is set by the summation thread recall that the pthread program   figure had the parent thread wait for the summation thread using the  pthread j oin statement we perform the equivalent of this in the win api  using the wai tforsingleobj ect function which causes the creatil gthread  to block until the summation thread has exited we cover synchronization  objects in more detail in chapter   java threads  tlu·eads are the fundamental model of program execution in a java program  and the java language and its api provide a rich set of features for the creation  and management of threads all java programs comprise at least a single thread  of control even a simple java program consisting of only a main method  runs as a single thread in the jvm  there are two teclmiques for creating threads in a java program one  approach is to create a new class that is derived from the thread class and  to override its run method an alternative and more commonly used\\xad teclmique is to define a class that implements the runnable interface the  runnable interface is defined as follows  public interface runnable    public abstract void run  when a class implements runnable it must define a run method the code  implementing the run method is what runs as a separate thread  figure shows the java version of a multithreaded program that  determines the summation of a non negative integer the summation class  implements the runnable interface thread creation is performed by creating     include windows h   include stdio h  dword sum i data is shared by the thread s i  i the thread runs in this

object instance of the thread class and passing the constructor a runnable  object  creating a thread object does not specifically create the new thread rather  it is the start method that creates the new thread calling the start  method for the new object does two things  it allocates memory and initializes a new thread in the jvm  it calls the run method making the thread eligible to be run by the  jvm note that we never call the run method directly ratheh we call  the start method and it calls the run method on our behalf  when the summation program runs two threads are created by the jvm  the first is the parent thread which starts execution in the main method  the second thread is created when the start method on the thread object  is invoked this child thread begins execution in the run method of the  summation class after outputting the value of the summation this thread  terminates when it exits from its run method  sharing of data between threads occurs easily in win and pthreads since  shared data are simply declared globally as a pure object oriented language  java has no such notion of global data if two or more threads are to share  data in a java program the sharing occurs by passing references to the shared  object to the appropriate threads in the java program shown in figure  the main thread and the summation thread share the object instance of the sum  class this shared object is referenced through the appropriate get sum and  setsum methods you might wonder why we don t use an integer object  rather than designing a new sum class the reason is that the integer class is  immutable that is once its value is set it cannot change  recall that the parent threads in the pthreads and win libraries use  pthread j oin and wai tforsingledbj ect  respectively to wait for  the summation threads to finish before proceeding the join method  in java provides similar functionality notice that join can throw an  interruptedexception which we choose to ignore  in this section we discuss some of the issues to consider with multithreaded  programs   the fork and exec system calls  in chapter we described how the fork system call is used to create a  separate duplicate process the semantics of the fork and exec system  calls change in a multithreaded program  if one thread in a program calls fork does the new process duplicate  all threads or is the new process single threaded some unix systems have  chosen to have two versions of fork one that duplicates all threads and  another that duplicates only the thread that invoked the fork system call  the exec system call typically works in the same way as described  in chapter that is if a thread invokes the exec system call the program   chapter  the jvm and the host operating system  the jvm is typically implemented on top of a host operating system see  figure  this setup allows the jvm to hide the implementation details  of the underlying operating system and to provide a consistent abstract  environment that allows java programs to operate on any platform that  supports a jvm the specification for the jvm does not indicate how java  threads are to be mapped to the underlying operating system instead leaving  that decision to the particular implementation of the jvm for example the  windows xp operating system uses the one to one model therefore each  java thread for a jvm running on such a system maps to a kernel thread on  operating systems that use the many to many model such as tru unix a  java thread is mapped according to the many to manymodel solaris initially  implemented the jvm using themany to one model the greenthreads library  mentioned earlier later releases of the jvm were implementedusing the  many to inany model beginning with solaris java threads were mapped  using the one to one model in addition there may be a relationship between  the java thread library and the thread library on the host operating system  for example implementations of a jvm for the windows family of operating  systems might use the win api when creating java threads linux solaris  and mac os x systems might use the pthreads api  specified in the parameter to exec will replace the entire process including  all threads  which of the two versions of fork to use depends on the application  if exec is called immediately after forking then duplicating all threads is  unnecessary as the program specified in the parameters to exec will replace  the process in this instance duplicating only the calling thread is appropriate  if however the separate process does not call exec after forking the separate  process should duplicate all threads  cancellation  is the task of terminating a thread before it has completed  for example if multiple threads are concurrently searching through a database  and one thread returns the result the remaining threads might be canceled  another situation might occur when a user presses a button on a web browser  that stops a web page from loading any further often a web page is loaded  using several threads each image is loaded in a separate thread when a  user presses the stop button on the browser all threads loading the page are  canceled  a thread that is to be canceled is often referred to as the  cancellation of a target thread may occur in two different scenarios  asynchronous cancellation one thread immediately terminates the  target thread    deferred cancellation the target thread periodically checks whether it  should terminate allowing it an opportunity to terminate itself in an  orderly fashion  the difficulty with cancellation occurs in situations where resources have  been allocated to a canceled thread or where a thread is canceled while in  the midst of updating data it is sharing with other threads this becomes  especially troublesome with asynchronous cancellation often the operating  system will reclaim system resources from a canceled thread but will not  reclaim all resources therefore canceling a thread asynchronously may not  free a necessary system wide resource  with deferred cancellation in contrast one thread indicates that a target  thread is to be canceled but cancellation occurs only after the target thread has  checked a flag to determine whether or not it should be canceled the thread  can perform this check at a at which it can be canceled safely pthreads  refers to such points as   signal handling  a is used in unix systems to notify a process that a particular event has  occurred a signal may be received either synchronously or asynchronously  depending on the source of and the reason for the event being signaled all  signals whether synchronous or asynchronous follow the same pattern  a signal is generated by the occurrence of a particular event  a generated signal is delivered to a process  once delivered the signal must be handled  examples of synchronous signals include illegal memory access and  division by if a running program performs either of these actions a signal  is generated synchronous signals are delivered to the same process that  performed the operation that caused the signal that is the reason they are  considered synchronous  when a signal is generated by an event external to a running process that  process receives the signal asynchronously examples of such signals include  terminating a process with specific keystrokes such as control c and  having a timer expire typically an asynchronous signal is sent to another  process  a signal may be handled by one of two possible handlers  a default signal handler  a user defilced signal handler  every signal has a that is run by the kernel when  handling that signal this default action can be overridden by a  signal handle that is called to handle the signal signals are handled in  different ways some signals such as changing the size of a window are  simply ignored others such as an illegal memory access are handled by  terminating the program   chapter  handling signals in single threaded programs is straightforward signals  are always delivered to a process however delivering signals is more  complicated in multithreaded programs where a process may have several  threads where then should a signal be delivered  in generat the following options exist  deliver the signal to the thread to which the signal applies  deliver the signal to every thread in the process  deliver the signal to certain threads in the process  assign a specific thread to receive all signals for the process  the method for delivering a signal depends on the type of signal generated  for example synchronous signals need to be delivered to the thread causing  the signal and not to other threads in the process however the situation with  asynchronous signals is not as clear some asynchronous signals such as a  signal that terminates a process control c for example should be  sent to all threads  most multithreaded versions of unix allow a thread to specify which  signals it will accept and which it will block therefore in some cases an  asynchronous signal may be delivered only to those threads that are not  blocking it however because signals need to be handled only once a signal  is typically delivered only to the first thread found that is not blocking it  the standard unix function for delivering a signal is kill pid t pid int  signal which specifies the process pi d to which a particular signal is to be  delivered posix pthreads provides the pthread kill pthread t tid int  signal function which allows a signal to be delivered to a specified thread   tid  although windows does not explicitly support for signals they  can be emulated using apcs the apc facility  allows a user thread to specify a function that is to be called when the user  thread receives notification of a particular event as indicated by its name  an apc is roughly equivalent to an asynchronous signal in unix however  whereas unix must contend with how to deal with signals in a multithreaded  environment the apc facility is more straightforward since an apc is delivered  to a particular thread rather than a process   thread pools  in section we mentioned multithreading in a web server in this situation  whenever the server receives a request it creates a separate thread to service  the request whereas creating a separate thread is certainly superior to creating  a separate process a multithreaded server nonetheless has potential problems  the first issue concerns the amount of time required to create the thread prior  to servicing the request together with the fact that this thread will be discarded  once it has completed its work the second issue is more troublesome if we  allow all concurrent requests to be serviced in a new thread we have not placed  a bound on the number of threads concurrently active in the system unlimited  threads could exhaust system resources such as cpu tince or memory one  solution to this problem is to use a    the general idea beh ind a thread pool is to create a number of threads at  process startup and place them into a pool where they sit and wait for work  when a server receives a request it awakens a thread from this pool if one  is available and passes it the request for service once the thread completes  its service it returns to the pool and awaits more work if the pool contains no  available thread the server waits until one becomes free  thread pools offer these benefits  servicing a request with an existing thread is usually faster than waiting  to create a thread  a thread pool limits the number of threads that exist at any one point  this is particularly important on systems that cannot support a large  number of concurrent threads  the number of threads in the pool can be set heuristically based on factors  such as the number of cpus in the system the amount of physical memory  and the expected number of concurrent client requests more sophisticated  thread pool architectures can dynamically adjust the number of threads in the  pool according to usage patterns such architectures provide the further benefit  of having a smaller pool thereby consuming less memory when the load  on the system is low  the win api provides several functions related to thread pools using  the thread pool api is similar to creating a thread with the thread create  function as described in section  here a function that is to run as a  separate thread is defin ed such a function may appear as follows  dword winapi poolfunction avoid param     this function runs as a separate thread    a pointer to poolfunction is passed to one of the functions in the thread  pool api and a thread from the pool executes this function one such member  in the thread pool api is the queueuserworkitemo function which is passed  three paranceters  lpthread starlroutine function a pointer to the function that is to  nm as a separate thread  pvoid param the parameter passed to function  ulong flags flags indicating how the thread pool is to create and  manage execution of the thread  an example of invoking a function is  queueuserworkitem poolfunction null   this causes a thread from the thread pool to invoke poolfunction  on behalf of the programmer in this instance we pass no parameters to   chapter   lightweight process       d kamalthcead  figure lightweight process lwp  poolfunction because we specify as a flag we provide the thread pool  with no special instructions for thread creation  other members in the win thread pool api include utilities that invoke  functions at periodic intervals or when an asynchronous i request completes  the java util concurrent package in java provides a thread pool utility  as well   thread specific data  threads belonging to a process share the data of the process indeed this  sharing of data provides one of the benefits of multithreaded programming  however in some circumstances each thread need its own copy of  certain data we will call such data for example in a  transaction processing system we might service each transaction in a separate  thread furthermore each transaction might be assigned a unique identifier to  associate each thread with its unique identifier we could use thread specific  data most thread libraries including win and pthreads provide some  form of support for thread specific data java provides support as well   scheduler activations  a final issue to be considered with multithreaded programs concerns com\\xad munication between the kernel and the thread library which may be required  by the many to many and two level models discussed in section  such  coordination allows the number of kernel threads to be dynamically adjusted  to help ensure the best performance  many systems implementing either the many to many or the two level  model place an intermediate data structure between the user and kernel  threads this data structure typically known as a lightweight process or  lwp is shown in figure to the user thread library the lwp appears to  be a virtual processor on which the application can schedule a user thread to  run each lwp is attached to a kernel thread and it is kernel threads that the  operating system schedules to run on physical processors if a kernel thread  blocks such as while waiting for an i operation to complete the lwp blocks  as well up the chain the user level thread attached to the lwp also blocks  an application may require any number of lwps to run efficiently consider  a cpu bound application running on a single processor in this scenario only     one thread can run at once so one lwp is sufficient an application that is i o\\xad intensive may require multiple lwps to execute however typically an lwp is  required for each concurrent blocking system call suppose for example that  five different file read requests occur simultaneously five lwps are needed  because all could be waiting for i completion in the kernel if a process has  only four lwps then the fifth request must wait for one of the lwps to return  from the kernel  one scheme for communication between the user thread library and the  kernel is known as it works as follows the kernel  provides an application with a set of virtual processors lwps and the  application can schedule user threads onto an available virtual processor  furthermore the kernel must inform an application about certain events this  procedure is known as an upcalls are handled by the thread library  with an and upcall handlers must run on a virtual processor  one event that triggers an upcall occurs when an application thread is about to  block in this scenario the kernel makes an upcall to the application informing  it that a thread is about to block and identifying the specific thread the kernel  then allocates a new virtual processor to the application the application runs  an upcall handler on this new virtual processor which saves the state of the  blocking thread and relinquishes the virtual processor on which the blocking  thread is running the upcall handler then schedules another thread that is  eligible to run on the new virtual processor when the event that the blocking  thread was waiting for occurs the kernel makes another upcall to the thread  library informilcg it that the previously blocked thread is now eligible to run  the up call handler for this event also requires a virtual processor and the kernel  may allocate a new virtual processor or preempt one of the user threads and  run the upcall handler on its virtual processor after marking the mblocked  thread as eligible to run the application schedules an eligible thread to run on  an available virtual processor  in this section we explore how threads are implemented in windows xp and  linux systems   windows xp threads  windows xp implements the win api which is the primary api for the  family of microsoft operating systems windows  nt and xp  indeed much of what is mentioned in this section applies to this entire family  of operating systems  a windows xp application runs as a separate process and each process  may contain one or more threads the win api for creating threads is  covered in section  windows xp uses the one to one mapping described  in section  where each user level thread maps to an associated kernel  thread however windows xp also provides support for a library which  provides the functionality of the many to many model section  by using  the thread library any thread belonging to a process can access the address  space of the process   chapter  the general components of a thread include  a thread id uniquely identifying the thread  a register set representing the status of the processor  a user stack employed when the thread is running in user mode and a  kernel stack employed when the thread is running in kernel mode  a private storage area used by various run time libraries and dynamic link  libraries dlls  the register set stacks and private storage area are known as the rcc nw yt  of the thread the primary data structures of a thread include  ethread executive thread block  kthread kernel thread block  tee thread environment block  the key components of the ethread include a pointer to the process  to which the thread belongs and the address of the routine in which the  thread starts control the ethread also contains a pointer to the corresponding  kthread  ethread  kernel space user space  figure data structures of a windows xp thread    the kthread includes scheduling and synchronization inforn ation for  the thread in addition the kthread includes the kernel stack used when the  thread is running in kernel mode and a pointer to the teb  the ethread and the kthread exist entirely in kernel space this means  that only the kernel can access thern the teb is a user space data structure that  is accessed when the thread is running in user mode among other fields the  teb contains the thread identifier a user mode stack and an array for thread\\xad specific data which windows xp terms the structure of  a windows xp thread is illustrated in figure   linux threads  linux provides the fork system call with the traditional functionality of  duplicating a process as described in chapter linux also provides the ability  to create threads using the clone system call however linux does not  distinguish between processes and threads in fact linux generally uses the  term task rather than process or thread when referring to a flow of control  within a program  when clone is invoked it is passed a set of flags which determine how  much sharing is to take place between the parent and child tasks some of these  flags are listed below  flag meaning  clone fs file system information is shared  clone vm the same memory space is shared  clone sighand signal handlers are shared  clone files the set of open files is shared  for example if clone is passed the flags clone fs clone vm  clone sighand and clone files the parent and child tasks will share  the same file system information such as the current working directory the  same memory space the same signal handlers and the same set of open files  using clone in this fashion is equivalent to creating a thread as described  in this chapter since the parent task shares most of its resources with its child  task however if none of these flags is set when clone is invoked no  sharing takes place resulting in functionality similar to that provided by the  fork system call  the varying level of sharing is possible because of the way a task is  represented in the linux kernel a unique kernel data structure specifically  struct task struct exists for each task in the system this data structure  instead of storing data for the task contains pointers to other data structures  where these data are stored for example data structures that represent the list  of open files signal handling information and virtual memory when fork  is invoked a new task is created along with a copy of all the associated data  structures of the parent process a new task is also created when the clone  system call is made howevet rather than copying all data structures the new   chapter   task points to the data structures of the parent task depending on the set of  flags passed to clone  several distributions of the linux kernel now include the nptl thread  library nptl which stands for native posix thread library provides a  posix compliant thread model for linux systems along with several other  features such as better support for smp systems as well as taking advantage  of numa support in addition the start up cost for creating a thread is  lower with nptl than with traditional linux threads finally with nptl the  system has the potential to support hundreds of thousands of threads such  support becomes more important with the growth of multicore and other smp  systems  a thread is a flow of control within a process a multithreaded process contains  several different flows of control within the same address space the benefits of  multithreading include increased responsiveness to the user resource sharing  within the process economy and scalability issues such as more efficient use  of multiple cores  user level threads are threads that are visible to the programmer and are  unknown to the kernel the operating system kernel supports and manages  kernel level threads in general user level threads are faster to create and  manage than are kernel threads as no intervention from the kernel is required  three different types of models relate user and kernel threads the many to one  model maps many user threads to a single kernel thread the one to one model  maps each user thread to a corresponding kernel thread the many to many  model multiplexes many user threads to a smaller or equal number of kernel  threads  most modern operating systems provide kernel support for threads among  these are windows nt and xp as well as solaris and linux  thread libraries provide the application programmer with an api for  creating and managing threads three primary thread libraries are in com\\xad mon use posix pthreads win threads for windows systems and java  threads  multithreaded programs introduce many challenges for the programmer  including the semantics of the fork and exec system calls other issues  include thread cancellation signal handling and thread specific data   provide two programming examples in which multithreading does not  provide better performance than a single threaded solution   write a ncultithreaded java pthreads or win program that outputs  prime numbers this program should work as follows the user will  run the program and will enter a number on the command line the    program will then create a separate thread that outputs all the prime  numbers less than or equal to the number entered by the user   which of the following components of program state are shared across  threads in a multithreaded process  a register values  b

the program is less than  the number of processors  b the number of kernel threads allocated to the program is equal to  the number of processors  c the number of kernel threads allocated to the program is greater  than the number of processors but less than the number of user\\xad level threads   what are two differences between user level threads and kernel level  threads under what circumstances is one type better than the other   exercise in chapter involves designing an echo server using the  java threading api however this server is single threaded meaning  that the server cannot respond to concurrent echo clients until the current  client exits modify the solution to exercise so that the echo server  services each client in a separate request   modify the socket based date server figure in chapter so that  the server services each client request in a separate thread   can a multithreaded solution using multiple user level threads achieve  better performance on a

circumstances does a multithreaded solution using multi\\xad ple kernel threads provide better performance than a single threaded  solution on a single processor system   the fibonacci sequence is the series of numbers      formally it can be expressed as  fib  fih  jibn jibn jibn  write a multithreaded program that generates the fibonacci sequence  using either the java pthreads or win thread library this program    should work as follows the user will enter on the command line  the number of fibonacci numbers that the program is to generate  the program will then create a separate thread that will generate the  fibonacci numbers placing the sequence in data that can be shared by  the threads an array is probably the most convenient data structure  when the thread finishes execution the parent thread will output the  sequence generated by the child thread because the parent thread cannot  begin outputting the fibonacci sequence until the child thread finishes  this will require having the parent thread wait for the child thread to  finish using the techniques described in section   a pthread program that performs the smmnation function was provided  in section  rewrite this program in java   as described in section  linux does not distinguish between  processes and threads instead linux treats both in the same way  allowing a task to be more akin to a process or a thread depending  on the set of flags passed to the clone system call however many  operating systems such as windows xp and solaris treat processes  and threads differently typically such systems use a notation wherein  the data structure for a process contains pointers to the separate threads  belonging to the process contrast these two approaches for modeling  processes and threads within the kernel   describe the actions taken by a thread library to context switch between  user level threads  the set of projects below deal with two distinct topics naming service and  matrix muliplication  project naming service project  a naming service such as dns for domain name system can be used to  resolve ip names to ip addresses for example when someone accesses the host  www westminstercollege edu a naming service is used to determine the  ip address that is mapped to the ip name www westminstercollege edu  this assignment consists of writing a multithreaded nan ling service in java  using sockets see section   the java net api provides the following mechanism for resolving ip names  inetaddress hostaddress  inetaddress getbyname www westminstercollege edu  string ipaddress hostaddress gethostaddress  where getbyname throws an unknownhostexception if it is unable to  resolve the host name   chapter  the server  the server will listen to port waiting for client connections when  a client connection is made the server will service the connection in a separate  thread and will resume listening for additional client connections once a  client makes a connection to the server the client will write the ip name it  wishes the server to resolve such as www westminstercollege edu\\xad to the socket the server thread will read this ip name from the socket and  either resolve its ip address or if it cannot locate the host address catch an  unknownhostexception the server will write the ip address back to the  client or in the case of an unknownhostexception will write the message   unable to resolve host host name once the server has written  to the client it will close its socket connection  the client  initially write just the server application and connect to it via telnet  for example assuming the server is running on the localhost a telnet session  would appear as follows client responses appear in  telnec localhost  connected to localhost  escape character is a   i vv h destrninstercollege edu    connection closed by foreign host  by initially having telnet act as a client you can more easily debug any problems  you may have with your server once you are convinced your server is working  properly you can write a client application the client will be passed the ip  name that is to be resolved as a parameter the client will open a socket  connection to the server and then write the if name that is to be resolved it  will then read the response sent back by the server as an example if the client  is named nsclient it is invoked as follows  java nsclient www westminstercollege edu  and the server will respond with the corresponding if address or unknown  host message once the client has output the if address it will close its socket  connection  project matrix multiplication project  given two matrices a and b where matrix a contains m rows and k columns  and matrix b contains k rows and n columns the of a and b  is matrix c where c contains m rows and n coh ms the entry in matrix c  for row i column j c j is the sum of the products of the elements for row i  in matrix a and column j in matrix b that is for this project calculate each element c j in a separate worker thread this  will involve creating m x n worker threads the main or parent thread  will initialize the matrices a and b and allocate sufficient memory for matrix  c which will hold the product of matrices a and b these matrices will be  declared as global data so that each worker thread has access to a b and c  matrices a and b can be initialized statically as shown below   define m   define k   define n  int a m k  int b k n  int c m n            alternatively they can be populated by reading in values from a file  passing parameters to each thread  the parent thread will create m x n worker threads passing each worker the  values of row i and column j that it is to use in calculating the matrix product  this requires passing two parameters to each thread the easiest approach with  pthreads and win is to create a data structure using a struct the members  of this structure are i and j and the structure appears as follows  i structure for passing data to threads i  struct v     int i i row i  int j i column i  both the pthreads and win programs will create the worker threads  using a strategy similar to that shown below  i we have to create m n worker threads i  for i  i m i   for j  j n j    struct v data struct v rnalloc sizeof struct v  data i i  data j j  i now create the thread passing it data as a parameter i   chapter  public class

pthreads  function or the createthread  win function which in turn will pass it  as a parameter to the function that is to run as a separate thread  sharing of data between java threads is different from sharing between  threads in pthreads or win one approach is for the main thread to create  and initialize the matrices a b and c this main thread will then create the  worker threads passing the three matrices along with row i and column j\\xad to the constructor for each worker thus the outline of a worker thread appears  in figure  waiting for threads to complete  once all worker threads have completed the main thread will output the  product contained in matrix c this requires the main thread to wait for  all worker threads to finish before it can output the value of the matrix  product several different strategies can be used to enable a thread to wait  for other threads to finish section describes how to wait for a child  thread to complete using the win pthreads and java thread libraries  win provides the wai tforsingleobj ect function whereas pthreads  and java use pthread j oin and join respectively however in these  programming examples the parent thread waits for a single child thread to  finish completing this exercise will require waiting for multiple threads  in section  we describe the wai tforsingleobj ect function which  is used to wait for a single thread to finish however the win api also  provides the wai tformultipledbj ects function which is used when  waiting for multiple threads to complete waitformultipleobjectso is  passed four

of thread handle objects of size n the  parent thread can wait for all its child threads to complete with the statement  waitformultipleobjects n thandles true infinite  a simple strategy for waiting on several threads using the pthreads  pthread join or java s join is to enclose the join operation within a  simple for loop for example you could join on ten threads using the pthread  code depicted

java beveridge and wiener  and cohen and woodring describe multithreading using win   cpu scheduling is the basis of multiprogrammed operating systems by  switching the cpu among processes the operating system can make the  computer more productive in this chapter we introduce basic cpu scheduling  concepts and present several cpu scheduling algorithms we also consider the  problem of selecting an algorithm for a particular system  in chapter we introduced threads to the process model on operating  systems that support them it is kernel level threads not processes that are  in fact being scheduled by the operating system however the terms process  scheduling and thread scheduling are often used interchangeably in this  chapter we use process scheduling when discussing general scheduling concepts  and thread scheduling to refer to thread specific ideas  to introduce cpu scheduling which is the basis for multiprogrammed  operating systems  to describe various cpu scheduling algorithms  to discuss evaluation criteria for selecting a cpu scheduling algorithm for  a particular system  in a single processor system only one process can run at a time any others  must wait until the cpu is free and can be rescheduled the objective of  multiprogramming is to have some process ruming at all times to maximize  cpu utilization the idea is relatively simple a process is executed until  it must wait typically for the completion of some i o request in a simple  computer system the cpu then just sits idle all this waiting time is wasted  no useful work is accomplished with multiprogramming we try to use this  time productively several processes are kept in memory at one time when  one process has to wait the operating system takes the cpu away from that     chapter

burst  figure i alternating sequence of cpu and bursts  process and gives the cpu to another process this pattern continues every  time one process has to wait another process can take over use of the cpu  scheduling of this kind is a fundamental operating system function  almost all computer resources are scheduled before use the cpu is of course  one of the primary computer resources thus its scheduling is central to  operating system design   cpu i o burst cycle  the success of cpu scheduling depends on an observed property of processes  process execution consists of a cycle of cpu execution and i wait processes  alternate between these two states process execution begins with a cpu burst  that is followed by an i o burst which is followed by another cpu burst then  another i burst and so on eventually the final cpu burst ends with a system  request to terminate execution figure   the durations of cpu bursts have been measured extensively although  they vary greatly from process to process and from computer to computer  they tend to have a frequency curve similar to that shown in figure the  curve is generally characterized as exponential or hyperexponential with a  large number of short cpu bursts and a small number of long cpu bursts  an i o bound program typically has many short cpu bursts a cpu bound           c  aj   l u             burst duration milliseconds  figure histogram of cpu burst durations  program might have a few long cpu bursts this distribution can be important  in the selection of an appropriate cpu scheduling algorithm   cpu scheduler  whenever the cpu becomes idle the operating system must select one of the  processes in the ready queue to be executed the selection process is carried  out by the short term scheduler or cpu scheduler the scheduler selects a  process from the processes in memory that are ready to execute and allocates  the cpu to that process  note that the ready queue is not necessarily a first in first out fifo queue  as we shall see when we consider the various scheduling algorithms a ready  queue can be implen ented as a fifo queue a priority queue a tree or sirnply  an unordered linked list conceptually however all the processes in the ready  queue are lined up waiting for a chance to run on the cpu the records in the  queues are generally process control blocks pcbs of the processes   preemptive scheduling  cpu scheduling decisions may take place under the following four circum\\xad stances  when a process switches from the running state to the waiting state for  example as the result of an i request or an invocation of wait for the  termination of one of the child processes  when a process switches from the numing state to the ready state for  example when an interrupt occurs   chapter  when a process switches from the waiting state to the ready state for  example at completion of i  when a process terminates  for situations and there is no choice in terms of scheduling a new process   if one exists in the ready queue must be selected for execution there is a  choice however for situations and  when scheduling takes place only under circumstances and we say  that the scheduling scheme is nonpreemptive or cooperative otherwise it  is preemptive under nonpreemptive scheduling once the cpu has been  allocated to a process the process keeps the cpu until it releases the cpu either  by terminating or by switching to the waiting state this scheduling method  was used by microsoft windows x windows introduced preemptive  scheduling and all subsequent versions of windows operating systems have  used preemptive scheduling the mac os x operating system for the macintosh  also uses preemptive scheduling previous versions of the macintosh operating  system relied on cooperative scheduling cooperative scheduling is the only  method that can be used on certain hardware platforms because it does not  require the special hardware for example a timer needed for preemptive  scheduling  unfortunately preemptive scheduling incurs a cost associated with access  to shared data consider the case of two processes that share data while one  is updating the data it is preempted so that the second process can run the  second process then tries to read the data which are in an inconsistent state in  such situations we need new mechanisms to coordinate access to shared data  we discuss this topic in chapter  preemption also affects the design of the operating system kernel during  the processing of a system call the kernel may be busy with an activity on  behalf of a process such activities may involve changing important kernel  data for instance i queues what happens if the process is preempted  in the middle of these changes and the kernel or the device driver needs  to read or modify the same structure chaos ensues certain operating sys\\xad tems including most versions of unix deal with this problem by waiting  either for a system call to com plete or for an i o block to take place before  doing a context switch this scheme ensures that the kernel structure is  simple since the kernel will not preempt a process while the kernel data  structures are in an inconsistent state unfortunately this kernel execution  model is a poor one for supportilg real time computing and multipro\\xad cessing these problems and their solutions are described i j sections  and  because interrupts can by definition occur at any time and because  they cannot always be ignored by the kernel the sections of code affected  by interrupts must be guarded from simultaneous use the operating system  needs to accept interrupts at almost all times otherwise input might be lost or  output overwritten so that these sections of code are not accessed concurrently  by several processes they disable interrupts at entry and reenable interrupts  at exit it is important to note that sections of code that disable interrupts do  not occur very often and typically contain few instructions      dispatcher  another component involved in the cpu scheduling function is the dispatcher  the dispatcher is the module that gives control of the cpu to the process selected  by the short term scheduler this function involves the following  switching context  switching to user mode  jumping to the proper location in the user program to restart that program  the dispatcher should be as fast as possible since it is invoked during every  process switch the time it takes for the dispatcher to stop one process and  start another running is known as the dispatch latency  different cpu scheduling algorithms have different properties and the choice  of a particular algorithm may favor one class of processes over another in  choosing which algorithm to use in a particular situation we must consider  the properties of the various algorithms  many criteria have been suggested for comparing cpu scheduling algo\\xad rithms which characteristics are used for comparison can make a substantial  difference in which algorithm is judged to be best the criteria include the  following  cpu utilization we want to keep the cpu as busy as possible concep\\xad tually cpu utilization can range from to percent in a real system it  should range from percent for a lightly loaded system to percent   for a heavily used system  throughput if the cpu is busy executing processes then work is being  done one measure of work is the number of processes that are completed  per time unit called throughput for long processes this rate may be one  process per hour for short transactions it may be ten processes per second  turnaround time from the point of view of a particular process the  important criterion is how long it takes to execute that process the interval  from the time of submission of a process to the time of completion is the  turnaround time turnaround tim e is the sum of the periods spent waiting  to get into memory waiting in the ready queue executing on the cpu and  doing i  waiting time the cpu scheduling algorithm does not affect the amount  of time during which a process executes or does i it affects only the  an ount of time that a process spends waiting in the ready queue waiting  time is the sum of the periods spent waiting in the ready queue  response time in an interactive system turnaround time may not be  the best criterion often a process can produce some output fairly early  and can continue computing new results while previous results are being   chapter   output to the user thus another measure is the time from the submission  of a request until the first response is produced this measure called  response time is the tince it takes to start responding not the time it takes  to output the response the turnaround time is generally limited by the  speed of the output device  it is desirable to maximize cpu utilization and throughput and to minirnize  turnaround time waiting time and response time in most cases we optimize  the average measure however under some circumstances it is desirable  to optimize the minimum or maximum values rather than the average for  example to guarantee that all users get good service we may want to minirnize  the maximum response time  investigators have suggested that for interactive systems such as time\\xad sharing systerns it is more important to minimize the variance in the response  time than to minimize the average response time a system with reasonable  and predictable response time may be considered more desirable than a system  that is faster on the average but is highly variable however little work has  been done on cpu scheduling algorithms that minimize variance  as we discuss various cpu scheduling algorithms in the following section  we illustrate their operation an accurate illustration should involve many  processes each a sequence of several hundred cpu bursts and i o bursts  for simplicity though we consider only one cpu burst in milliseconds per  process in our examples our measure of comparison is the average waiting  time more elaborate evaluation mechanisms are discussed in section  cpu scheduling deals with the problem of deciding which of the processes in the  ready queue is to be allocated the cpu there are many different cpu scheduling  algorithms in this section we describe several of them   first come first served scheduling  by far the simplest cpu scheduling algorithm is the first come first served   fcfs scheduling algorithm with this scheme the process that requests the  cpu first is allocated the cpu first the implementation of the fcfs policy is  easily managed with a fifo queue when a process enters the ready queue its  pcb is linked onto the tail of the queue when the cpu is free it is allocated to  the process at the head of the queue the running process is then removed from  the queue the code for fcfs scheduling is simple to write and understand  on the negative side the average waiting time under the fcfs policy is  often quite long consider the following set of processes that arrive at time  with the length of the cpu burst given in milliseconds  process burst time   p  p  po     if the processes ani ve in the order p p p and are served in fcfs order  we get the result shown in the following gantt chart which is a bar chart that  illustrates a particular schedule including the start and finish times of each of  the participating processes    the waiting time is milliseconds for process p milliseconds for process  p and milliseconds for process p thus the average waiting time is     ncilliseconds if the processes arrive in the order p p p  however the results will be as shown in the following gantt chart    the average waiting time is now    milliseconds this reduction  is substantial thus the average waiting time under an fcfs policy is generally  not minimal and may vary substantially if the processes cpu burst times vary  greatly  in addition consider the performance of fcfs scheduling in a dynamic  situation assume we have one cpu bound process and many i o bound  processes as the processes flow armmd the system the following scenario  may result the cpu bound process will get and hold the cpu during this  time all the other processes will finish their i and will move into the ready  queue waiting for the cpu while the processes wait in the ready queue the  i devices are idle eventually the cpu bound process finishes its cpu burst  and moves to an i device all the i o bound processes which have short  cpu bursts execute quickly and move back to the i queues at this point  the cpu sits idle the cpu bound process will then move back to the ready  queue and be allocated the cpu again all the i processes end up waiting in  the ready queue until the cpu bound process is done there is a convoy effect  as all the other processes wait for the one big process to get off the cpu this  effect results in lower cpu and device utilization than might be possible if the  shorter processes were allowed to go first  note also that the fcfs scheduling algorithm is nonpreemptive once the  cpu has been allocated to a process that process keeps the cpu until it releases  the cpu either by terminating or by requesting i the fcfs algorithm is thus  particularly troublesome for time sharing systems where it is important that  each user get a share of the cpu at regular intervals it would be disastrous to  allow one process to keep the cpu for an extended period   shortest job first scheduling  a different approach to cpu scheduling is the shortest job first sjf schedul\\xad ing algorithm this algorithm associates with each process the length of the  process s next cpu burst when the cpu is available it is assigned to the process   chapter  that has the smallest next cpu burst if the next cpu bursts of two processes are  the same fcfs scheduling is used to break the tie note that a more appropriate  term for this scheduling method would be the shortest next cpu burst algorithm  because scheduling depends on the length of the next cpu burst of a process  rather than its total length we use the term sjf because m ost people and  textbooks use this term to refer to this type of scheduling  as an example of sjf scheduling consider the following set of processes  with the length of the cpu burst given in milliseconds  process burst time  pl  p  p  p  using sjf scheduling we would schedule these processes according to the  following gantt chart     the waiting time is milliseconds for process p milliseconds for process  p milliseconds for process p and milliseconds for process p thus the  average waiting time is    i  milliseconds by comparison if  we were using the fcfs scheduling scheme the average waiting time would  be milliseconds  the sjf scheduling algorithm is provably optimal in that it gives the  minimum average waiting time for a given set of processes moving a short  process before a long one decreases the waiting time of the short process more  than it increases the waiting time of the long process consequently the average  waiting time decreases  the real difficulty with the sjf algorithm is knowing the length of the next  cpu request for long term job scheduling in a batch system we can use as  the length the process time limit that a user specifies when he submits the  job thus users are motivated to estimate the process time limit accurately  since a lower value may mean faster response too low a value will cause  a time limit exceeded error and require resubmission sjf scheduling is used  frequently in long term scheduling  although the sjf algorithm is optimal it cannot be implemented at the level  of short term cpu scheduling with short term scheduling there is no way to  know the length of the next cpu burst one approach is to try to approximate  sjf scheduling we may not know the length of the next cpu burst but we may  be able to predict its value we expect that the next cpu burst will be similar  in length to the previous ones by computing an approximation of the length  of the next cpu burst we can pick the process with the shortest predicted cpu  burst    the next cpu burst is generally predicted as an exponential average of  the measured lengths of previous cpu bursts we can define the exponential  average with the following formula let t be the length of the nth cpu burst  and let t t be our predicted value for the next cpu burst then for a s a   define  the value of tn contains our most recent information t stores the past history  the parameter a controls the relative weight of recent and past history in  our prediction if a then tn l t and recent history has no effect current  conditions are assumed to be transient if a then tn l t and only the most  recent cpu burst matters history is assumed to be old and irrelevant more  commonly a  so recent history and past history are equally weighted  the initial to can be defined as a constant or as an overall system average  figure shows an exponential average with a and to  to lmderstand the behavior of the exponential average we can expand the  formula for tn l by substituting for t to find  since both a and a are less than or equal to each successive term has  less weight than its predecessor  the sjf algorithm can be either preemptive or nonpreemptive the choice  arises when a new process arrives at the ready queue while a previous process is  still executing the next cpu burst of the newly arrived process may be shorter  time   cpu burst f     guess t    figure prediction of the length of the next cpu burst   chapter  than what is left of the currently executing process a preemptive sjf algorithm  will preempt the currently executing process whereas a nonpreemptive sjf  algorithm will allow the currently running process to finish its cpu burst  preemptive sjf scheduling is sometimes called shortest remaining time first  scheduling  as an example consider the following four processes with the length of  the cpu burst given in milliseconds  process arrival time burst time  pl  p  p  p  if the processes arrive at the ready queue at the times shown and need the  indicated burst times then the resulting preemptive sjf schedule is as depicted  in the following gantt chart     process p is started at time since it is the only process in the queue process  p arrives at time the remaining time for process p milliseconds is  larger than the time required by process p milliseconds so process p is  preempted and process p is scheduled the average waiting time for this  example is         milliseconds  nonpreemptive sjf scheduling would result in an average waiting time of  milliseconds   priority scheduling  the sjf algorithm is a special case of the general priority scheduling algorithm  a priority is associated with each process and the cpu is allocated to the process  with the highest priority equal priority processes are scheduled in fcfs order  an sjf algorithm is simply a priority algorithm where the priority p is the  inverse of the predicted next cpu burst the larger the cpu burst the lower  the priority and vice versa  note that we discuss scheduling in terms of high priority and low priority  priorities are generally indicated by some fixed range of numbers such as  to or to however there is no general agreement on whether is the  highest or lowest priority some systems use low numbers to represent low  priority others use low numbers for high priority this difference can lead to  confusion in this text we assume that low numbers represent high priority  as an example consider the following set of processes assumed to have  arrived at time in the order with the length of the cpu burst  given in milliseconds    process burst time  rity  pl     p  p  p  ps  using priority scheduling we would schedule these processes according to the  following gantt chart     the average waiting time is milliseconds  priorities can be defined either internally or externally internally defined  priorities use some nceasurable quantity or quantities to compute the priority  of a process for example time limits memory requirements the number of  open files and the ratio of average i burst to average cpu burst have been  used in computing priorities external priorities are set by criteria outside the  operating system such as the importance of the process the type and amount  of funds being paid for computer use the department sponsoring the work  and other often politicat factors  priority scheduling can be either preemptive or nonpreemptive when a  process arrives at the ready queue its priority is compared with the priority  of the currently running process a preemptive priority scheduling algorithm  will preempt the cpu if the priority of the newly arrived process is higher  than the priority of the currently running process a nonpreemptive priority  scheduling algorithm will simply put the new process at the head of the ready  queue  a rnajor problem with priority scheduling algorithms is indefinite block\\xad ing or starvation a process that is ready to run but waiting for the cpu can  be considered blocked a priority scheduling algorithm can leave some low\\xad priority processes waiting indefinitely in a heavily loaded computer system a  steady stream of higher priority processes can prevent a low priority process  from ever getting the cpu generally one of two things will happen either the  process will eventually be run at a m sunday when the system is finally  lightly loaded or the cornputer systern will eventually crash and lose all  unfinished low priority processes rumor has it that when they shut down  the ibm at mit in they found a low priority process that had been  submitted in and had not yet been run  a solution to the problem of indefinite blockage of low priority processes  is aging aging is a techniqtje of gradually increasing the priority of processes  that wait in the system for a long time for example if priorities range from   low to high we could increase the priority of a waiting process by   every minutes eventually even a process with an initial priority of  would have the highest priority in the system and would be executed in fact  it would take no more than hours for a priority process to age to a  priority process   chapter   round robin scheduling  the round robin rr scheduling algorithm is designed especially for time\\xad sharing systems it is similar to fcfs scheduling but preemption is added to  enable the system to switch between processes a small unit of time called a  time quantum or time slice is defined a time quantum is generally fronc  to milliseconds in length the ready queue is treated as a circular queue  the cpu scheduler goes around the ready queue allocating the cpu to each  process for a time interval of up to time quantum  to implement rr scheduling we keep the ready queue as a fifo queue o£  processes new processes are added to the tail of the ready queue the cpu  scheduler picks the first process from the ready queue sets a timer to interrupt  after time quantum and dispatches the process  one of two things will then happen the process may have a cpu burst of  less than time quantum in this case the process itself will release the cpu  voluntarily the scheduler will then proceed to the next process in the ready  queue otherwise if the cpu burst of the currently running process is longer  than time quantum the timer will go off and will cause an interrupt to the  operating system a context switch will be executed and the process will be  put at the tail o£ the ready queue the cpu scheduler will then select the next  process in the ready queue  the average waiting time under the rr policy is often long consider the  following set of processes that arrive at time with the length of the cpu burst  given in milliseconds  process burst time  if we use a time quantum of milliseconds then process p gets the first  milliseconds since it requires another milliseconds it is preempted after  the first time quantum and the cpu is given to the next process in the queue  process p process p does not need milliseconds so it quits before its time  quantum expires the cpu is then given to the next process process p once  each process has received time quantum the cpu is returned to process p  for an additional time quantum the resulting rr schedule is as follows      let s calculate the average waiting time for the above schedule p waits for  millisconds  p waits for millisconds and p waits for millisconds  thus the average waiting time is  milliseconds  in the rr scheduling algorithm no process is allocated the cpu for more  than time quantum in a row unless it is the only runnable process if a    process s cpu burst exceeds time quantum that process is preempted and is  pt back in the ready queue the rr scheduling algorithm is thus preemptive  if there are n processes in the ready queue and the time quantum is q  then each process gets in of the cpu time in chunks of at most q time units  each process must wait no longer than  x q time units until its  next time quantum for example with five processes and a time quantum of  milliseconds each process will get up to milliseconds every milliseconds  the performance of the rr algorithm depends heavily on the size of the  time quantum at one extreme if the time quantum is extremely large the  rr policy is the same as the fcfs policy in contrast if the time quantum  is extremely small say millisecond the rr approach is called processor  sharing and in theory creates the appearance that each of processes has its  own processor running at i the speed of the real processor this approach  was used in control data corporation cdc hardware to implement ten  peripheral processors with only one set of hardware and ten sets of registers  the hardware executes one instruction for one set of registers then goes on to  the next this cycle continues resulting in ten slow processors rather than one  fast one actually since the processor was much faster than memory and each  instruction referenced memory the processors were not much slower than ten  real processors would have been  in software we need also to consider the effect of context switching on the  performance of rr scheduling assume for example that we have only one  process of time units if the quantum is time units the process finishes  in less than time quantum with no overhead if the quantum is time units  however the process requires quanta resulting in a context switch if the  time quantum is time unit then nine context switches will occur slowing the  execution of the process accordingly figure   thus we want the time quantum to be large with respect to the context\\xad switch time if the context switch time is approximately percent of the  time quantum then about percent of the cpu time will be spent in context  switching in practice most modern systems have time quanta ranging from   to milliseconds the time required for a context switch is typically less  than microseconds thus the context switch time is a small fraction of the  time quantum  process time quantum context  switches  figure how a smaller time quantum increases context switches   chapter  process time  time quantum  figure how turnaround time varies with the time quantum  turnaround time also depends on the size of the time quantum as we  can see from figure the average turnaround time of a set of processes  does not necessarily improve as the time quantum size increases in general  the average turnaround time can be improved if most processes finish their  next cpu burst in a single time quantum for example given three processes  of time units each and a quantum of time unit the average turnaround  time is if the time quantum is however the average turnaround time  drops to if context switch time is added in the average turnaround time  increases even more for a smaller time quantum since more context switches  are required  although the time quantum should be large compared with the context\\xad switch time it should not be too large if the time quantum is too large rr  scheduling degenerates to an fcfs policy a rule of thumb is that percent of  the cpu bursts should be shorter than the time quantum   multilevel queue scheduling  another class of scheduling algorithms has been created for situations in  which processes are easily classified into different groups for example a  common division is made between foreground interactive processes and  background batch processes these two types of processes have different  response time requirements and so may have different scheduling needs in  addition foreground processes may have priority externally defined over  background processes  a multilevel queue scheduling algorithm partitions the ready queue into  several separate queues figure  the processes are permanently assigned to  one queue generally based on some property of the process such as memory  highest priority lowest priority  figure multilevel queue scheduling  size process priority or process type each queue has its own scheduling  algorithm for example separate queues might be used for foreground and  background processes the foreground queue might be scheduled by an rr  algorithm while the background queue is scheduled by an fcfs algorithm  in addition there must be scheduling among the queues which is com\\xad monly implemented as fixed priority preemptive scheduling for example the  foreground queue may have absolute priority over the background queue  let s look at an example of a multilevel queue scheduling algorithm with  five queues listed below in order of priority  system processes  interactive processes  interactive editing processes  batch processes  student processes  each queue has absolute priority over lower priority queues no process in the  batch queue for example could run unless the queues for system processes  interactive processes and interactive editing processes were all empty if an  interactive editing process entered the ready queue while a batch process was  running the batch process would be preempted  another possibility is to time slice among the queues here each queue gets  a certain portion of the cpu time which it can then schedule among its various  processes for instance in the foreground background queue example the  foreground queue can be given percent of the cpu time for rr scheduling  among its processes whereas the background queue receives percent of the  cpu to give to its processes on an fcfs basis   chapter   multilevel feedback queue scheduling  normally when the multilevel queue scheduling algorithm is used processes  are permanently assigned to a queue when they enter the system if there  are separate queues for foreground and background processes for example  processes do not move from one queue to the other since processes do not  change their foreground or background nature this setup has the advantage  of low scheduling overhead but it is inflexible  the multilevel feedback queue scheduling algorithm in contrast allows  a process to move between queues the idea is to separate processes according  to the characteristics of their cpu bursts if a process uses too much cpu time  it will be moved to a lower priority queue this scheme leaves i o bound and  interactive processes in the higher priority queues in addition a process that  waits too long in a lower priority queue may be moved to a higher priority  queue this form of aging prevents starvation  for example consider a multilevel feedback queue scheduler with three  queues numbered from to figure  the scheduler first executes all  processes in queue only when queue is empty will it execute processes  in queue similarly processes in queue will only be executed if queues  and are empty a process that arrives for queue will preempt a process in  queue a process in queue will in turn be preempted by a process arriving  for queue  a process entering the ready queue is put in queue a process in queue  is given a time quantum of milliseconds if it does not filcish within this time  it is moved to the tail of queue if queue is empty the process at the head  of queue is given a quantum of milliseconds if it does not complete it is  preempted and is put into queue processes in queue are run on an fcfs  basis but are run only when queues and are empty  this scheduling algorithm gives highest priority to any process with a cpu  burst of milliseconds or less such a process will quickly get the cpu finish  its cpu burst and go off to its next i burst processes that need more than   but less than milliseconds are also served quickly although with lower  priority than shorter processes long processes automatically sink to queue   and are served in fcfs order with any cpu cycles left over from queues  and  figure multilevel feedback queues     in general a multilevel feedback queue scheduler is defined by the  following parameters  the number of queues  the scheduling algorithm for each queue  the method used to determine when to upgrade a process to a higher\\xad priority queue  the method used to determine when to demote a process to a lower\\xad priority queue  the method used to determine which queue a process will enter when that  process needs service  the definition of a multilevel feedback queue scheduler makes it the most  general cpu scheduling algorithm it can be configured to match a specific  system under design unfortunately it is also the most complex algorithm  since defining the best scheduler requires some means by which to select  values for all the parameters  in chapter we introduced threads to the process model distinguishing  between user level and kernel level threads on operating systems that support  them it is kernel level threads not processes that are being scheduled by  the operating system user level threads are managed by a thread library  and the kernel is unaware of them to run on a cpu user level threads  must ultimately be mapped to an associated kernel level thread although  this mapping may be indirect and may use a lightweight process lwp in this  section we explore scheduling issues involving user level and kernel level  threads and offer specific examples of scheduling for pthreads   contention scope  one distinction between user level and kernel level threads lies in how they  are scheduled on systems implementing the many to one section  and  many to many section  models the thread library schedules user level  threads to run on an available lwp a scheme known as process contention  scope pcs since competition for the cpu takes place among threads belonging  to the same process when we say the thread library schedules user threads onto  available lwps we do not mean that the thread is actually running on a cpu  this would require the operating system to schedule the kernel thread onto  a physical cpu to decide which kernel thread to schedule onto a cpu the  kernel uses system contention scope scs competition for the cpu with scs  scheduling takes place among all threads in the system systems usilcg the  one to one model section  such as windows xp solaris and linux  schedule threads using only scs  typically pcs is done according to priority the scheduler selects the  runnable thread with the highest priority to run user level thread priorities   chapter   are set by the programmer and are not adjusted by the thread library although  some thread libraries may allow the programmer to change the priority of  a thread it is important to note that pcs will typically preempt the thread  currently running in favor of a higher priority thread however there is no  guarantee of time slicing section  among threads of equal priority   pthread scheduling  we provided a sample postx pthread program in section  along with an  introduction to thread creation with pthreads now we highlight the posix  pthread api that allows specifying either pcs or scs during thread creation  pthreads identifies the following contention scope values  pthread scope process schedules threads using pcs scheduling  pthread scope system schedules threads using scs scheduling  on systems implementing the many to many model the  pthread scope process policy schedules user level threads onto available  lwps the number of lwps is maintained by the thread library perhaps using  scheduler activations section  the pthread scope system scheduling  policy will create and bind an lwp for each user level thread on many to many  systems effectively mapping threads using the one to one policy  the pthread ipc provides two functions for getting and setting the  contention scope policy  pthread attr setscope pthread attr t attr int scope  pthread attr getscope pthread attr t attr int scope  the first parameter for both functions contains a pointer to the attribute set for  the thread the second parameter for the pthread attr setscope function  is passed either the pthread scope system or the pthread scope process  value indicating how the contention scope is to be set in the case of  pthread attr getscope  this second parameter contaiils a pointer to an  int value that is set to the current value of the contention scope if an error  occurs each of these functions returns a non zero value  in figure we illustrate a pthread scheduling api the pro\\xad gram first determines the existing contention scope and sets it to  pthread scoplprocess it then creates five separate threads that will  run using the scs scheduling policy note that on some systems only certain  contention scope values are allowed for example linux and mac os x  systems allow only pthread scope system  our discussion thus far has focused on the problems of scheduling the cpu in  a system with a single processor if multiple cpus are available load sharing  becomes possible however the

possibilities have been tried and as we saw with single\\xad processor cpu scheduling there is no one best solution here we discuss  several concerns in multiprocessor scheduling we concentrate on systems   chapter  in which the processors are identical homogeneous in terms of their  functionality we can then use any available processor to run any process  in the queue note however that even with homogeneous multiprocessors  there are sometimes limitations on scheduling consider a system with an l  device attached to a private bus of one processor processes that wish to use  that device must be scheduled to run on that processor   approaches to multiple processor scheduling  one approach to cpu scheduling in a n ultiprocessor system has all scheduling  decisions i o processing and other system activities handled by a single  processor the master server the other processors execute only user code  this asymmetric multiprocessing is simple because only one processor  accesses the system data structures reducing the need for data sharing  a second approach uses symmetric multiprocessing smp where each  processor is self scheduling all processes may be in a common ready queue or  each processor may have its own private queue of ready processes regardless  scheduling proceeds by having the scheduler for each processor examine the  ready queue and select a process to execute as we shall see in chapter  if we have multiple processors trying to access and update a common data  structure the scheduler must be programmed carefully we must ensure that  two processors do not choose the same process and that processes are not lost  from the queue virtually all modern operating systems support smp including  windows xp windows solaris linux and mac os x in the remainder of  this section we discuss issues concerning smp systems   processor affinity  consider what happens to cache memory when a process has been running on  a specific processor the data most recently accessed by the process populate  the cache for the processor and as a result successive memory accesses by  the process are often satisfied in cache memory now consider what happens  if the process migrates to another processor the contents of cache memory  must be invalidated for the first processor and the cache for the second  processor must be repopulated because of the high cost of invalidating and  repopulating caches most smp systems try to avoid migration of processes  from one processor to another and instead attempt to keep a process rumung  on the same processor this is known as processor affinity that is a process  has an affinity for the processor on which it is currently rumting  processor affinity takes several forms when an operating system has a  policy of attempting to keep a process running on the same processor but  not guaranteeing that it will do so we have a situation known as soft affinity  here it is possible for a process to migrate between processors some systems   such as lim ix also provide system calls that support hard affinity thereby  allowing a process to specify that it is not to migrate to other processors solaris  allows processes to be assigned to limiting which processes can  run on which cpus it also implements soft affinity  the main memory architecture of a system can affect processor affinity  issues figure illustrates an architecture featuring non uniform memory  access numa in which a cpu has faster access to some parts of main memory  than to other parts typically this occurs in systems containing combined cpu    computer  figure numa and cpu scheduling  and memory boards the cpus on a board can access the memory on that board  with less delay than they can access memory on other boards in the system  if the operating system s cpu scheduler and memory placement algorithms  work together then a process that is assigned affinity to a particular cpu  can be allocated memory on the board where that cpu resides this example  also shows that operating systems are frequently not as cleanly defined and  implemented as described in operating system textbooks rather the solid  lines between sections of an operating system are frequently only dotted  lines with algorithms creating connections in ways aimed at optimizing  performance and reliability   load balancing  on smp systems it is important to keep the workload balanced among all  processors to fully utilize the benefits of having more than one processor  otherwise one or more processors may sit idle while other processors have  high workloads along with lists of processes awaiting the cpu load balancing  attempts to keep the workload evenly distributed across all processors in  an smp system it is important to note that load balancing is typically only  necessary on systems where each processor has its own private queue of eligible  processes to execute on systems with a common run queue load balancing  is often unnecessary because once a processor becomes idle it immediately  extracts a rmmable process from the common run queue it is also important to  note however that in most contemporary operating systems supporting smp  each processor does have a private queue of eligible processes  there are two general approaches to load balancing push migration and  pull migration with push migration a specific task periodically checks the  load on each processor and if it finds an imbalance evenly distributes the  load by moving or pushing processes from overloaded to idle or less busy  processors pull migration occurs when an idle processor pulls a waiting task  from a busy processor push and pull migration need not be mutually exclusive  and are in fact often implemented in parallel on load balancing systems for  example the linux scheduler described in section  and the ule scheduler   chapter  available for freebsd systems implement both techniqles linux runs its load\\xad balancing algorithm every milliseconds push migration or whenever the  run queue for a processor is empty pull migration  interestingly load balancing often counteracts the benefits of processor  affinity discussed in section  that is the benefit of keeping a process  running on the same processor is that the process can take advantage of its data  being in that processor s cache memory either pulling or pushing a process  from one processor to another invalidates this benefit as is often the case  in systems engineering there is no absolute rule concerning what policy is  best thus in some systems an idle processor always pulls a process from  a non idle processor and in other systems processes are moved only if the  imbalance exceeds a certain threshold   multicore processors  traditionally smp systems have allowed several threads to run concurrently by  providing multiple physical processors however a recent trend in computer  hardware has been to place multiple processor cores on the same physical chip  resulting in a each core has a register set to maintain its  architectural state and appears to the operating system to be a separate  physical processor smp systems that use multicore processors are faster and  consume less power than systems in which each processor has its own physical  chip  multicore processors may complicate scheduling issues let s consider how  this can happen researchers have discovered that when a processor accesses  memory it spends a significant amount of time waiting for the data to become  available this situation known as a may occur for various  reasons such as a cache miss accessing data that is not in cache memory  figure illustrates a memory stall in this scenario the processor can spend  up to percent of its time waiting for data to become available from memory  to remedy this situation many recent hardware designs have implemented  multithreaded processor cores in which two or more hardware threads are  assigned to each core that way if one thread stalls while waiting for memory  the core can switch to another thread figure illustrates a dual threaded  processor core on which the execution of thread and the execution of thread  are interleaved from an operating system perspective each hardware thread  appears as a logical processor that is available to run a software thread thus  on a dual threaded dual core system four logical processors are presented to  the operating system the ultrasparc tl cpu has eight cores per chip and four   compute cycle memory stall cycle  thread c m c m c m c m  time  figure memory stall    thread c m c m c m c  thread c m c m c m c  time  figure multithreaded multicore system  hardware threads per core from the perspective of the operating system there  appear to be logical processors  in general there are two ways to multithread a processor  u u ·c u •chccu  multithreading with coarse grained multithreading a thread  executes on a processor until a long latency event such as a memory stall occurs  because of the delay caused by the long latency event the processor must  switch to another thread to begin execution however the cost of switching  between threads is high as the instruction pipeline must be flushed before  the other thread can begin execution on the processor core once this new  thread begins execution it begins filling the pipeline with its instructions  fine grained or interleaved multithreading switches between threads at a  much finer level of granularity typically at the boundary of an instruction  cycle however the architectural design of fine grained systems includes logic  for thread switching as a result the cost of switching between threads is small  notice that a multithreaded multicore processor actually requires two  different levels of scheduling on one level are the scheduling decisions that  must be made by the operating system as it chooses which software thread to  run on each hardware thread logical processor for this level of scheduling  the operating system may choose any scheduling algorithm such as those  described in section a second level of scheduling specifies how each core  decides which hardware thread to run there are several strategies to adopt  in this situation the ultrasparc tl mentioned earlier uses a simple round\\xad robin algorithm to schedule the four hardware threads to each core another  example the intel itanium is a dual core processor with hvo hardware\\xad managed threads per core assigned to each hardware thread is a dynamic  urgency value ranging from to with representing the lowest urgency  and the highest the itanium identifies five different events that may trigger  a thread switch when one of these events occurs the thread switching logic  compares the urgency of the two threads and selects the thread with the highest  urgency value to execute on the processor core   virtualization and scheduling  a system with virtualization even a single cpu system frequently acts like  a multiprocessor system the virtualization software presents one or more  virtual cpus to each of the virtual machines rum ing on the system and  then schedules the use of the physical cpus among the virtual machines  the significant variations between virtualization technologies make it difficult  to summarize the effect of virtualization on scheduling see section   in general though most virtualized environments have one host operating   chapter   system and many guest operating systems the host operating system creates  and manages the virtual machines and each virtual n achine has a guest  operating system installed and applications running within that guest eacb  guest operating system may be fine tuned for specific use cases applications  and users including time sharing or even real time operation  any guest operating system scheduling algorithm that assumes a certain  amount of progress in a given amount of time will be negatively impacted by  virtualization consider a time sharing operating system that tries to allot  milliseconds to each time slice to give users a reasonable response time within  a virtual machine this operating system is at the mercy of the virtualization  system as to what cpu resources it actually receives a given millisecond  time slice may take much more than milliseconds of virtual cpu time  depending on how busy the system is the time slice may take a second or more  resulting in very poor response times for users logged into that virtual machine  the effect on a real time operating system would be even more catastrophic  the net effect of such scheduling layering is that individual virtualized  operating systems receive only a portion of the available cpu cycles even  though they believe they are receiving all of the cycles and indeed that they  are scheduling all of those cycles commonly the time of day clocks in virtual  machines are incorrect because timers take longer to trigger than they would on  dedicated cpus virtualization can thus lmdo the good scheduling algorithm  efforts of the operating systems within virtual machines  we turn next to a description of the scheduling policies of the solaris windows  xp and linux operating systems it is important to remember that we are  describing the scheduling of kernel tlueads with solaris and windows xp  recall that linux does not distinguish between processes and threads thus  we use the term task when discussing the linux scheduler   example solaris scheduling  solaris uses priority based thread scheduling where each thread belongs to  one of six classes  time sharing ts  interactive ia  real time rt  system sys  fair share fss  fixed priority fp  within each class there are different priorities and different scheduling algo\\xad rithms  the default scheduling class for a process is time sharing the scheduling  policy for the time sharing class dynamically alters priorities and assigns time                          figure solaris dispatch table for time sharing and interactive threads  slices of different lengths using a multilevel feedback queue by default there  is an inverse relationship between priorities and time slices the higher the  priority the smaller the time slice and the lower the priority the larger the  time slice interactive processes typically have a higher priority cpu bound  processes a lower priority this scheduling policy gives good response time  for interactive processes and good throughput for cpu bound processes the  interactive class uses the same scheduling policy as the time sharing class but  it gives windowing applications such as those created by the kde or gnome  window managers a higher priority for better performance  figure shows the dispatch table for scheduling time sharing and  interactive threads these two scheduling classes include priority levels  but for brevity we display only a handful the dispatch table shown in figure   contains the following fields  priority the class dependent priority for the time sharing and interactive  classes a higher number indicates a higher priority  time quantum the time quantum for the associated priority this illus\\xad trates the inverse relationship between priorities and time quanta the  lowest priority priority has the highest tince quantum millisec\\xad onds and the highest priority priority has the lowest time quantum   milliseconds  time quantum expired the new priority of a thread that has used  its entire time quantum without blocking such threads are considered   chapter  cpu intensive as shown in the table these threads have their priorities  lowered  return from sleep the priority of a thread that is returning from sleeping   such as waiting for i as the table illustrates when i is available  for a waiting thread its priority is boosted to between and thus  supporting the scheduling policy of providing good response time for  interactive processes  threads in the real time class are given the highest priority this assignment  allows a real time process to have a guaranteed response from the system  within a bounded period of time a real time process will run before a process  in any other class in general however few processes belong to the real time  class  solaris uses the system class to run kernel threads such as the scheduler  and paging daemon once established the priority of a system thread does not  change the system class is reserved for kernel use user processes ruming in  kernel mode are not in the system class  the fixed priority and fair share classes were introduced with solaris  threads in the fixed priority class have the same priority range as those in  the time sharing class however their priorities are not dynamically adjusted  the fair share scheduling class uses cpu instead of priorities to  make scheduling decisions cpu shares indicate entitlement to available cpu  resources and are allocated to a set of processes known as a project  each scheduling class includes a set of priorities however the scheduler  converts the class specific priorities into global priorities and selects the thread  with the highest global priority to n m the selected thread n ms on the cpu  until it blocks  uses its time slice or is preempted by a higher priority  thread if there are multiple threads with the same priority the scheduler uses  a round robin queue figure illustrates how the six scheduling classes  relate to one another and how they map to global priorities notice that the  kernel maintains threads for servicing interrupts these threads do not  belong to any scheduling class and execute at the highest priority   as mentioned solaris has traditionally used the many to many model section   but switched to the one to one model section  beginning with  solaris   example windows xp scheduling  windows xp schedules threads using a priority based preemptive scheduling  algorithm the windows xp scheduler ensures that the highest priority thread  will always run the portion of the windows xp kernel that handles scheduling  is called the dispatcher a thread selected to run by the dispatcher will run until  it is preempted by a higher priority thread until it terminates until its time  quantum ends or until it calls a blocking system call such as for i if a  higher priority real time thread becomes ready while a lower priority thread  is running the lower priority thread will be preempted this preemption gives  a real time thread preferential access to the cpu when the thread needs such  access  the dispatcher uses a level priority scheme to determine the order of  thread execution priorities are divided into two classes the  global  priority  highest  lowest                figure solaris scheduling scheduling  order  first  last  contains threads having priorities from to and the contains  threads with priorities ranging from to there is also a thread running at  priority that is used for memory management the dispatcher uses a queue  for each scheduling priority and traverses the set of queues from highest to  lowest until it finds a thread that is ready to run if no thread is found  the dispatcher will execute a special thread called the  there is a relationship between the numeric priorities of the windows xp  kernel and the win api the win api identifies several priority classes to  which a process can belong these include  realtime priority class  higf lpriority class  abovknormalpriority class  normalpriority class   chapter               figure windows xp priorities  below normal priority class  idle priority class          priorities in all classes except the realtime priority class are variable  meaning that the priority of a thread belonging to one of these classes can  change  a thread within a given priority classes also has a relative priority the  values for relative priorities include  time critical  highest  above normal  normal  below normal  lowest  idle  the priority of each thread is based on both the priority class it belongs to and its  relative priority within that class this relationship is shown in figure the  values of the priority classes appear in the top row the left column contains the  values for the relative priorities for example if the relative priority of a thread  in the above normal priority class is normal the nunceric priority of  that thread is  furthermore each thread has a base priority representing a value in the  priority range for the class the thread belongs to by default the base priority  is the value of the normal relative priority for that class the base priorities  for each priority class are  realtime priority class  higrlpriority class    above normalpriority class  normalpriority class  below normalpriority class  idle priority class  processes are typically members of the normalpriority class a pro\\xad cess belongs to this class unless the parent of the process was of the  idle priority class or unless another class was specified when the process  was created the initial priority of a thread is typically the base priority of the  process the thread belongs to  when a thread s time quantun runs out that thread is interrupted if the  thread is in the variable priority class its priority is lowered the priority is  never lowered below the base priority however lowering the priority tends  to limit the cpu consumption of compute bound threads when a variable\\xad priority thread is released from a wait operation the dispatcher boosts the  priority the amount of the boost depends on what the thread was waiting  for for example a thread that was waiting for keyboard i would get a large  increase whereas a thread waiting for a disk operation would get a moderate  one this strategy tends to give good response times to interactive threads that  are using the mouse and windows it also enables i o bound threads to keep  the i devices busy while permitting compute bound threads to use spare  cpu cycles in the background this strategy is used by several time sharing  operating systems including unix in addition the window with which the  user is currently interacting receives a priority boost to enhance its response  time  when a user is running an interactive program the system needs to provide  especially good performance for this reason windows xp has a special  scheduling rule for processes in the normalpriority class windows xp  distinguishes between the foreground process that is currently selected on the  screen and the background processes that are not currently selected when a  process moves into the foreground windows xp increases the scheduling  quantum by some factor typically by this increase gives the foreground  process three times longer to run before a time sharing preemption occurs   example linux scheduling  prior to version the linux kernel ran a variation of the traditional unix  scheduling algorithm two problems with the traditional unix scheduler are  that it does not provide adequate support for smp systems and that it does  not scale well as the number of tasks on the system grows with version  the scheduler was overhauled and the kernel now provides a scheduling  algorithm that runs in constant time known as regardless of the  number of tasks on the system the new scheduler also provides increased  support for smp including processor affinity and load balancing as well as  providing fairness and support for interactive tasks  the linux scheduler is a preemptive priority based algorithm with two  separate priority ranges a real time range from to and a nice value ranging  from to these two ranges map into a global priority scheme wherein  numerically lower values indicate higher priorities   chapter  numeric  priority         relative  priority  highest  lowest time  quantum   ms   ms  figure the relationship between priorities and time slice length  unlike schedulers for many other systems including solaris section   and windows xp section  limx assigns higher priority tasks longer time  quanta and lower priority tasks shorter time quanta the relationship between  priorities and tim e slice length is shown in figure  a runnable task is considered eligible for execution on the cpu as long  as it has time remaining in its time slice when a task has exhausted its time  slice it is considered expired and is not eligible for execution again until all  other tasks have also exhausted their time quanta the kernel maintains a list  of all runnable tasks in a data structure because of its support for  smp each processor maintains its own nmqueue and schedules itself indepen\\xad dently each runqueue contains two priority arrays and the  active array contains all tasks with time remaining in their time slices and the  expired array contains all expired tasks each of these priority arrays contains a  list of tasks indexed according to priority figure  the scheduler chooses  the task with the highest priority from the active array for execution on the  cpu on multiprocessor machines this means that each processor is scheduling  the highest priority task from its own runqueue structure when all tasks have  exhausted their time slices that is the active array is empty the two priority  arrays are exchanged the expired array becomes the active array and vice  versa  linux implements real time scheduling as defined by posix b which is  described in section  real time tasks are assigned static priorities all  active  array  priority       task lists  o o      expired  array  priority      •   task lists  o o o    figure list of tasks indexed according to priority     other tasks have dynamic priorities that are based on their nice values plus or  minus the value the interactivity of a task determines whether the value   will be added to or subtracted from the nice value a task s interactivity is  deterncined by how long it has been sleeping while waiting for i tasks that  are more interactive typically have longer sleep times and therefore are more  likely to have adjustments closer to as the scheduler favors interactive  tasks the result of such adjustments will be higher priorities for these tasks  conversely tasks with shorter sleep times are often more cpu bound and thus  will have their priorities lowered  a task s dynamic priority is recalculated when the task has exhausted its  time quantum and is to be moved to the expired array thus when the two  arrays are exchanged all tasks in the new active array have been assigned new  priorities and corresponding time slices  how do we select a cpu scheduling algorithm for a particular system as we  saw in section there are many scheduling algorithms each with its own  parameters as a result selecting an algorithm can be difficult  the first problem is defining the criteria to be used in selecting an algorithm  as we saw in section criteria are often defined in terms of cpu utilization  response time or thxoughput to select an algorithm we must first define  the relative importance of these elements our criteria may include several  measures such as  maximizing cpu utilization under the constraint that the maximum  response time is second  maximizing throughput such that turnaround time is on average linearly  proportional to total execution time  once the selection criteria have been defined we want to evaluate the  algorithms under consideration we next describe the various evaluation  methods we can use   deterministic modeling  one major class of evaluation methods is analytic evaluation analytic  evaluation uses the given algorithm and the system workload to produce a  formula or number that evaluates the performance of the algorithm for that  workload  deterministic modeling is one type of analytic evaluation this method  takes a particular predetermined workload and defines the performance of each  algorithm for that workload for example assume that we have the workload  shown below all five processes arrive at time in the order given with the  length of the cpu burst given in milliseconds   chapter  process burst time     pj  p  po c  j  p  ps  consider the fcfs sjf and rr quantum milliseconds scheduling  algorithms for this set of processes which algorithm would give the minimum  average waiting time  for the fcfs algorithm we would execute the processes as     the waiting time is milliseconds for process p milliseconds for process  p milliseconds for process p milliseconds for process p and  milliseconds for process p thus the average waiting time is       milliseconds  with nonpreemptive sjf scheduling we execute the processes as   p    the waiting time is milliseconds for process p milliseconds for process  p milliseconds for process p milliseconds for process p and  milliseconds for process p thus the average waiting time is      i  milliseconds   with the rr algorithm we execute the processes as  p     the waiting time is milliseconds for process p milliseconds for process  p milliseconds for process p milliseconds for process p and  milliseconds for process p thus the average waiting time is       milliseconds  we see that in this case the average waiting time obtained with the sjf  policy is less than half that obtained with fcfs scheduling the rr algorithm  gives us an intermediate value  deterministic modeling is simple and fast it gives us exact numbers  allowing us to compare the algorithms however it requires exact numbers for  input and its answers apply only to those cases the main uses of deterministic  modeling are in describing scheduling algorithms and providing examples in    cases where we are running the same program over and over again and can  measure the program s processing requirements exactly we may be able to use  deterministic modeling to select a scheduling algorithm furthermore over a  set of examples deterministic modeling may indicate trends that can then be  analyzed and proved separately for example it can be shown that for the  environment described all processes and their times available at tirne the  sjf policy will always result in the rninimum waiting time   queueing models  on many systems the processes that are run vary from day to day so there  is no static set of processes or times to use for deterministic modeling what  can be determined however is the distribution of cpu and i bursts these  distributions can be measured and then approximated or simply estimated the  result is a mathematical formula describing the probability of a particular cpu  burst commonly this distribution is exponential and is described by its mean  similarly we can describe the distribution of times when processes arrive in  the system the arrival time distribution fron these two distributions it is  possible to compute the average throughput utilization waiting time and so  on for most algorithms  the computer system is described as a network of servers each server has  a queue of waiting processes the cpu is a server with its ready queue as is  the i system with its device queues knowing arrival rates and service rates  we can compute utilization average queue length average wait time and so  on this area of study is called queueing network analysis  as an example let n be the average queue length excluding the process  being serviced let w be the average waiting time in the queue and let a be  the average arrival rate for new processes in the queue such as three processes  per second we expect that during the time w that a process waits a x w  new processes will arrive in the queue if the system is in a steady state then  the number of processes leaving the queue must be equal to the number of  processes that arrive thus  n ax w  this equation known as little s formula is particularly useful because it is  valid for any scheduling algorithm and arrival distribution  we can use little s formula to compute one of the three variables if we  know the other two for example if we know that processes arrive every  second on average and that there are normally processes in the queue  then we can compute the average waiting time per process as seconds  queueing analysis can be useful in comparing scheduling algorithms  but it also has limitations at the moment the classes of algorithms and  distributions that can be handled are fairly limited the mathematics of  complicated algorithms and distributions can be difficult to work with thus  arrival and service distributions are often defined in mathematically tractable   but unrealistic ways it is also generally necessary to make a number of  independent assumptions which may not be accurate as a result of these  difficulties queueing models are often only approximations of real systems  and the accuracy of the computed results may be questionable   chapter  performance  statistics  for fcfs  performance  statistics  for sjf  performance  statistics  for rr q   figure evaluation of cpu schedulers by simulation   simulations  to get a more accurate evaluation of scheduling algorithms we can use  simulations rumung simulations involves programming a model of the  computer system software data structures represent the major components  of the system the simulator has a variable representing a clock as this  variable s value is increased the simulator modifies the system state to reflect  the activities of the devices the processes and the scheduler as the simulation  executes statistics that indicate algorithm performance are gathered and  printed  the data to drive the simulation can be generated in several ways the  most common method uses a random number generator that is programmed to  generate processes cpu burst times arrivals departures and so on according  to probability distributions the distributions can be defined mathematically   uniform exponential poisson or empirically if a distribution is to be defined  empirically measurements of the actual system under study are taken the  results define the distribution of events in the real system this distribution can  then be used to drive the simulation  a distribution driven simulation may be inaccurate however because of  relationships between successive events in the real system the frequency  distribution indicates only how many instances of each event occur it does not  indicate anything about the order of their occurrence to correct this problem  we can use trace tapes we create a trace tape by monitoring the real system and  recording the sequence of actual events figure  we then use this sequence  to drive the simulation trace tapes provide an excellent way to compare two  algorithms on exactly the same set of real inputs this method can produce  accurate results for its inputs  simulations can be expensive often requiring hours of computer time a  more detailed simulation provides more accurate results but it also takes more  computer time in addition trace tapes can require large amounts of storage     space finally the design coding and debugging of the simulator can be a  major task   implementation  even a simulation is of limited accuracy the only con lpletely accurate way  to evaluate a scheduling algorithm is to code it up put it in the operating  system and see how it works this approach puts the actual algorithm in the  real system for evaluation under real operating conditions  the major difficulty with this approach is the high cost the expense is  incurred not only in coding the algorithm and modifying the operating system  to support it along with its required data structures but also in the reaction  of the users to a constantly changing operating system most users are not  interested in building a better operating system they merely want to get their  processes executed and use their results a constantly changing operating  system does not help the users to get their work done  another difficulty is that the environment in which the algorithm is used  will change the environment will change not only in the usual way as new  programs are written and the types of problems change but also as a result  of the performance of the scheduler if short processes are given priority then  users may break larger processes into sets of smaller processes if interactive  processes are given priority over noninteractive processes then users may  switch to interactive use  for example researchers designed one system that classified interactive  and noninteractive processes automatically by looking at the amount of  terminal i if a process did not input or output to the terminal in a second  interval the process was classified as noninteractive and was moved to a  lower priority queue in response to this policy one programmer modified his  programs to write an arbitrary character to the terminal at regular intervals of  less than second the system gave his programs a high priority even though  the terminal output was completely meaningless  the most flexible scheduling algorithms are those that can be altered  by the system managers or by the users so that they can be tuned for  a specific application or set of applications a workstation that performs  high end graphical applications for instance may have scheduling needs  different from those of a web server or file server some operating systems\\xad particularly several versions of unix allow the system manager to fine tune  the scheduling parameters for a particular system configuration for example  solaris provides the dispadmin command to allow the system administrator  to modify the parameters of the scheduling classes described in section   another approach is to use apis that modify the priority of a process or  thread the java posix and winapi provide such functions the downfall  of this approach is that performance tuning a system or application most often  does not result in improved performance in more general situations  cpu scheduling is the task of selecting a waiting process from the ready queue  and allocating the cpu to it the cpu is allocated to the selected process by the  dispatcher   chapter  first come first served fcfs scheduling is the simplest scheduling algo\\xad rithm but it can cause short processes to wait for very long processes shortest\\xad job first sjf scheduling is provably optimal providing the shortest average  waiting time implementing sjf scheduling is difficult however because pre\\xad dicting the length of the next cpu burst is difficult the sjf algorithm is a special  case of the general priority scheduling algorithm which simply allocates the  cpu to the highest priority process both priority and sjf scheduling may suffer  from starvation aging is a technique to prevent starvation  round robin rr scheduling is more appropriate for a time shared inter\\xad active system rr scheduling allocates the cpu to the first process in the ready  queue for q time units where q is the time quantum after q time units if  the process has not relinquished the cpu it is preem pted and the process is  put at the tail of the ready queue the major problem is the selection of the  time quantum if the quantum is too large rr scheduling degenerates to fcfs  scheduling if the quantum is too small scheduling overhead in the form of  context switch time becomes excessive  the fcfs algorithm is nonpreemptive the rr algorithm is preemptive the  sjf and priority algorithms may be either preemptive or nonpreemptive  multilevel queue algorithms allow different algorithms to be used for  different classes of processes the most common model includes a foreground  interactive queue that uses rr scheduling and a background batch queue that  uses fcfs scheduling multilevel feedback queues allow processes to move  from one queue to another  many contemporary computer systems support multiple processors and  allow each processor to schedule itself independently typically each processor  maintains its own private queue of processes or threads all of which  are available to run additional issues related to multiprocessor scheduling  include processor affinity load balancing and multicore processing as well as  scheduling on virtualization systems  operating systems supporting threads at the kernel level must schedule  threads not processes for execution this is the case with solaris and  windows xp both of these systems schedule threads using preemptive  priority based scheduling algorithms including support for real time threads  the linux process scheduler uses a priority based algorithm with real time  support as well the scheduling algorithms for these three operating systems  typically favor interactive over batch and cpu bound processes  the wide variety of scheduling algorithms demands that we have methods  to select among algorithms analytic methods use mathematical analysis to  determine the performance of an algorithm simulation methods determine  performance by imitating the scheduling algorithm on a representative  sample of processes and computing the resulting performance however sim\\xad ulation can at best provide an approximation of actual system performance  the only reliable technique for evaluating a scheduling algorithm is to imple\\xad ncent the

cooperating process is one that can affect or be affected by other processes  executing in the system cooperating processes can either directly share a  logical address space that is both code and data or be allowed to share data  only through files or messages the former case is achieved through the use of  threads discussed in chapter concurrent access to shared data may result in  data

true   while counter    i do nothing i  nextconsumed buffer out  out out  buffer size  counter  i consume the item in nextconsumed i  although both the producer and consumer routines shown above are  correct separately they may not function correctly when executed concurrently  as an illustration suppose that the value of the variable counter is currently   and that the producer and consumer processes execute the statements   counter and counter concurrently following the execution of these  two statements the value of the variable counter may be  or the only  correct result though is counter  which is generated correctly if the  producer and consumer execute separately  we can show that the value of counter may be incorrect as follows note  that the statement counter may be implemented in machine language on  a typical machine as  register counter  register register  counter register  where register is one of the local cpu registers similarly the statement  register counter is implemented as follows  register counter  register register  counter register  where again register is on eo£ the local cpu registers even though register and  register may be the same physical register an accumulator say remember  that the contents of this register will be saved and restored by the interrupt  handler section      the concurrent execution of counter and counter is equivalent  to a sequential execution in which the lower level statements presented  previously are interleaved in some arbitrary order but the order within each  high level statement is preserved one such interleaving is  to producer execute register counter register   t producer execute register register  register   t consumer execute register counter register   t consumer execute register register register   t producer execute counter register counter   ts consumer execute counter register counter   notice that we have arrived at the incorrect state counter  indicating  that four buffers are full when in fact five buffers are full if we reversed the  order of the statements at t and t we would arrive at the incorrect state   counter   we would arrive at this incorrect state because we allowed both processes  to manipulate the variable counter concurrently a situation like this where  several processes access and manipulate the same data concurrently and the  outcome of the execution depends on the particular order in which the access  takes place is called a to guard against the race condition  above we need to ensure that only one process at a time can be manipulating  the variable counter to make such a guarantee we require that the processes  be synchronized in some way  situations such as the one just described occur frequently in operating  systems as different parts of the system manipulate resources furthermore  with the growth of multicore systems there is an increased emphasis on  developing multithreaded applications wherein several threads which are  quite possibly sharing data are rmming in parallel on different processing  cores clearly we want any changes that result from such activities not  to interfere with one another because of the importance of this issue a  major portion of this chapter is concerned with and  amongst cooperating processes  consider a system consisting of n processes po p  p i each process  has a segment of code called a cdticall in which the process may  be changing common variables updating a table writing a file and so on  the important feature of the system is that when one process is executing in  its critical section no other process is to be allowed to execute in its critical  section that is no two processes are executing in their critical sections at the  same time the critical section problem is to design a protocol that the processes  can use to cooperate each process must request permission to enter its critical  section the section of code implementing this request is the the  critical section may be followed by an exit the remaining code is the  the general structure of a typical process pi is shown in   chapter  do  i entry section i  critical section  i exit section i  remainder section   while true  figure general structure of a typical process a  figure the entry section and exit section are enclosed in boxes to highlight  these important segments of code  a solution to the critical section problem must satisfy the following three  requirements   mutual exclusion if process pi is executing in its critical section then no  other processes can be executing in their critical sections   progress if no process is executing in its critical section and some  processes wish to enter their critical sections then only those processes  that are not executing in their remainder sections can participate in  deciding which will enter its critical section next and this selection carmot  be postponed indefinitely  bounded waiting there exists a bound or limit on the number of times  that other processes are allowed to enter their critical sections after a  process has made a request to enter its critical section and before that  request is granted  we assume that each process is executing at a nonzero speed however we can  make no assumption concerning the relative of the n processes  at a given point in time many kernel mode processes may be active in the  operating system as a result the code implementing an operating system   kernel code is subject to several possible race conditions consider as an  example a kernel data structure that maintains a list of all open files in the  system this list must be modified when a new file is opened or closed adding  the file to the list or removing it from the list if two processes were to open files  simultaneously the separate updates to this list could result in a race condition  other kernel data structures that are prone to possible race conditions include  structures for maintaining memory allocation for maintaining process lists  and for interrupt handling it is up to kernel developers to ensure that the  operating system is free from such race conditions  two general approaches are used to handle critical sections in operating  systems  preemptive kernels and nonpreemptive kernels a preemptive  kernel allows a process to be preempted while it is running in kernel mode  a nonpreemptive kernel does not allow a process running in kernel mode     to be preempted a kernel mode process will run until it exits kernel mode  blocks or voluntarily yields control of the cpu obviously a nonpreemptive  kernel is essentially free from race conditions on kernel data structures as only  one process is active in the kernel at a time we cannot say the same about  preemptive kernels so they must be carefully designed to ensure that shared  kernel data are free from race conditions preemptive kernels are especially  difficult to design for smp architectures since in these environments it is  possible for two kernel mode processes to run simultaneously on different  processors  why then would anyone favor a preemptive kernel over a nonpreemptive  one a preemptive kernel is more suitable for real time programming as it will  allow a real time process to preempt a process currently running in the kernel  furthermore a preemptive kernel may be more responsive since there is less  risk that a kernel mode process will run for an arbitrarily long period before  relinquishing the processor to waiting processes of course this effect can be  minimized by designing kernel code that does not behave in this way later in  this chapter we explore how various operating systems manage preemption  within the kernel  next we illustrate a classic software based solution to the critical section  problem known as peterson s solution because of the way modern computer  architectures perform basic machine language instructions such as load and  store there are no guarantees that peterson s solution will work correctly on  such architectures however we present the solution because it provides a good  algorithmic description of solving the critical section problem and illustrates  some of the complexities involved in designing software that addresses the  requirements of mutual exclusion progress and bomcded waiting  peterson s solution is restricted to two processes that alternate execution  between their critical sections and remainder sections the processes are  numbered po and p for convenience when presenting pi we use pj to  denote the other process that is j equals i  peterson s solution requires the two processes to share two data items  int turn  boolean flag  the variable turn indicates whose turn it is to enter its critical section that is  if turn i then process pi is allowed to execute in its critical section the  flag array is used to indicate if a process is ready to enter its critical section  for example if flag i is true this value indicates that pi is ready to enter  its critical section with an explanation of these data structures complete we  are now ready to describe the algorithm shown in figure  to enter the critical section process pi first sets flag i to be true and  then sets turn to the value j thereby asserting that if the other process wishes  to enter the critical section it can do so if both processes try to enter at the same  time turn will be set to both i and j at roughly the sance time only one of these  assignments will last the other will occur but will be overwritten immediately   chapter  do  flag i true  turn j  while flag j  turn j  critical section  i flag i false i  remainder section   while true  figure the structure of process a in peterson s solution  the eventual value of turn determines which of the two processes is allowed  to enter its critical section first  we now prove that this solution is correct we need to show that  mutual exclusion is preserved  the progress requirement is satisfied  the bounded waiting requirement is met  to prove property we note that each p enters its critical section only  if either flag j  false or turn i also note that if both processes  can be executing in their critical sections at the same time then flag   flag  true these two observations imply that po and p could not have  successfully executed their while statements at about the same time since the  value of turn can be either or but camwt be both hence one of the processes   say pi must have successfully executed the while statencent whereas p  had to execute at least one additional statement turn j however at  that time flag j  true and turn j and this condition will persist as  long as pi is in its critical section as a result mutual exclusion is preserved  to prove properties and we note that a process p can be prevented from  entering the critical section only if it is stuck in the while loop with the condition  flag j true and turn j this loop is the only one possible if pi is not  ready to enter the critical section then flag j false and p can enter its  critical section if pj has set flag j to true and is also executing in its while  statement then either turn  i or turn  j if turn i then p will enter  the critical section if turn j then pi will enter the critical section however  once pi exits its critical section it will reset flag j to false allowing p to  enter its critical section if pi resets flag j to true it must also set turn to i  thus since p does not change the value of the variable turn while executing  the while statement p will enter the critical section progress after at most  one entry by p bounded waiting     do  acquire lock  critical section  i release lock i  remainder section   while true  figure solution to the critical section problem using locks  we have just described one software based solution to the critical section  problem however as mentioned software based solutions such as peterson s  are not guaranteed to work on modern computer architectures instead we  can generally state that any solution to the critical section problem requires a  simple tool a lock race conditions are prevented by requiring that critical  regions be protected by locks that is a process must acquire a lock before  entering a critical section it releases the lock when it exits the critical section  this is illustrated in figure  in the following discussions we explore several more solutions to the  critical section problem using techniques ranging from hardware to software\\xad based apis available to application programmers all these solutions are based  on the premise of locking however as we shall see the designs of such locks  can be quite sophisticated  we start by presenting some simple hardware instructions that are available  on many systems and showing how they can be used effectively in solving the  critical section problem hardware features can make any programming task  easier and improve system efficiency  the critical section problem could be solved simply in a uniprocessor envi\\xad ronment if we could prevent interrupts from occurring while a shared variable  was being modified in this manner we could be sure that the current sequence  of instructions would be allowed to execute in order without preemption no  other instructions would be run so no unexpected modifications could be  made to the shared variable this is often the approach taken by nonpreemptive  kernels  unfortunately this solution is not as feasible in a multiprocessor environ\\xad ment disabling interrupts on a multiprocessor can be time consuming as the  boolean testandset boolean target  boolean rv target   target true  return rv    figure the definition of the testandset

is passed to all the processors this message passing delays entry into  each critical section and system efficiency decreases also consider the effect  on a system s clock if the clock is kept updated by interrupts  many modern computer systems therefore provide special hardware  instructions that allow us either to test and modify the content of a word or  to swap the contents of two words is as one unin terruptible  unit we can use these special instructions to solve the critical section problem  in a relatively simple manner rather than discussing one specific instruction  for one specific machine we abstract the main concepts behind these types of  instructions by describing the testandset and swap instructions  the testandset instruction can be defined as shown in figure the  important characteristic of this instruction is that it is executed atomically  thus if two testandset instructions are executed simultaneously each on  a different cpu they will be executed sequentially in some arbitrary order if  the machine supports the testandset instruction then we can implement  mutual exclusion by declaring a boolean variable lock initialized to false  the structure of process p is shown in figure  the swap instruction in contrast to the testandset instruction  operates on the contents of two words it is defined as shown in figure  like the testandset instruction it is executed atomically if the machine  supports the swap instruction then mutual exclusion can be provided as  follows a global boolean variable lock is declared and is initialized to false  in addition each process has a local boolean variable key the structure of  process p is shown in figure  although these algorithms satisfy the mutual exclusion requirement they  do not satisfy the bounded waiting requirement in figure we present  another algorithm using the testandset instruction that satisfies all the  critical section requirements the common data structures are  void swap

exclusion requirement is met we note that process p can enter its critical  section only if either waiting i  false or key false the value  of key can become false only if the testandset is executed the first  process to execute the testandset will find key false all others must  wait the variable waiting i can become false only if another process  leaves its critical section only one waiting i is set to false maintaining the  mutual exclusion requirement  do  waiting i true  key true  while waiting i  key  key testandset lock  waiting i false  ii critical section  j i  n  while j i  waiting

met we note that the arguments  presented for mutual exclusion also apply here since a process exiting the  critical section either sets lock to false or sets waiting j to false both  allow a process that is waiting to enter its critical section to proceed  to prove that the bounded waiting requirement is met we note that when  a process leaves its critical section it scans the array waiting in the cyclic  ordering i  i   n   i it designates the first process in this  ordering that is in the entry section waiting j true as the next one to  enter the critical section any process waiting to enter its critical section will  thus do so within n turns  unfortunately for hardware designers implementing atomic testand\\xad set instructions on multiprocessors is not a trivial task such implementa\\xad tions are discussed in books on computer architecture  the hardware based solutions to the critical section problem presented in  section are complicated for application programmers to use to overcmrte  this difficulty we can use a synchronization tool called a  a semaphore s is an integer variable that apart from initialization is  accessed only through two standard atomic operations wait and signal   the wait operation was originally termed p from the dutch proberen to  test signal was originally called v from verhogen to increment the  definition of wait is as follows all modifications to the integer value of the semaphore in the wait and  signal operations must be executed indivisibly that is when one process  modifies the semaphore value no other process can simultaneously modify  that same semaphore value in addition in the case of wait s the testing of  the integer value of s s s as well as its possible modification s  must  be executed without interruption we shall see how these operations can be  implemented in section  first let us see how semaphores can be used   usage  operating systems often distinguish between counting and binary semaphores  the value of a counting semaphore can range over an unrestricted domain  the value of a binary semaphore can range only between and on some    systems binary semaphores are lmown as mutex locks as they are locks that  provide mutual exclusion  we can use binary semaphores to deal with the critical section problem £or  mljltiple processes then processes share a semaphore mutex initialized to  each process pi is organized as shown in figure  counting semaphores can be used to control access to a given resource  consisting of a finite number o£ instances the semaphore is initialized to the  number of resources available each process that wishes to use a resource  performs a wait operation on the semaphore thereby decrementing the  count when a process releases a resource it performs a signal operation   incrementing the count when the count for the semaphore goes to all  resources are being used after that processes that wish to use a resource will  block until the count becomes greater than  we can also use semaphores to solve various synchronization problems  for example consider two concurrently numing processes p with a statement   and p with a statement suppose we require that be executed only  after has completed we can implement this scheme readily by letting p  and p share a common semaphore synch initialized to and by inserting the  statements    signal synch  in process p and the statements  wait synch    in process p because synch is initialized to p will execute only after p  has invoked signal synch which is after statement has been executed   implementation  the main disadvantage of the semaphore definition given here is thatit requires  while a process is in its critical section any other process that  tries to enter its critical section must loop continuously in the entry code this  continual looping is clearly a problem in a real multiprogramming system  do  wait mutex  ii critical section  signal mutex  ii remainder section   while true  figure mutual exclusion implementation with semaphores   chapter  where a single cpu is shared among ncany processes busy waiting wastes  cpu cycles that some other process might be able to use productively this  type of semaphore is also called a because the process spins while  waiting for the lock spinlocks do have an advantage in that no context switch  is required when a process must wait on a lock and a context switch may  take considerable time thus when locks are expected to be held for short  times spinlocks are useful they are often employed on multiprocessor systems  where one thread can spin on one processor while another thread performs  its critical section on another processor  to overcome the need for busy waiting we can modify the definition of  the wait and signal semaphore operations when a process executes the  wait operation and finds that the semaphore value is not positive it must  wait however rather than engaging in busy waiting the process can block  itself the block operation places a process into a waiting queue associated  with the semaphore and the state of the process is switched to the waiting  state then control is transferred to the cpu scheduler which selects another  process to execute  a process that is blocked waiting on a semaphore s should be restarted  when some other process executes a signal operation the process is  restarted by a wakeup operation which changes the process from the waiting  state to the ready state the process is then placed in the ready queue the  cpu may or may not be switched from the running process to the newly ready  process depending on the cpu scheduling algorithm  to implement semaphores under this definition we define a semaphore as  a c struct  typedef struct  int value  struct process list   semaphore  each semaphore has an integer value and a list of processes list when  a process must wait on a semaphore it is added to the list of processes a  signal operation removes one process from the list of waiting processes  and awakens that process  the wait semaphore operation can now be defined as  wait semaphore s  s value   if s value    add this process to s list  block  the signal semaphore operation can now be defined as  signal semaphore s  s value  if s value    remove a process p fron s list  wakeup p      the block operation suspends the process that invokes it the wakeup p  operation resumes the execution of a blocked process p these two operations  are provided by the operating system as basic system calls  note that in this implementation semaphore values may be negative  although semaphore values are never negative under the classical definition of  semaphores with busy waiting if a semaphore value is negative its magnitude  is the number of processes waiting on that semaphore this fact results from  switching the order of the decrement and the test in the implementation of the  wait operation  the list of waiting processes can be easily implemented by a link field in  each process control block pcb each semaphore contains an integer value and  a pointer to a list of pcbs one way to add and rernove processes from the list  so as to ensure bounded waiting is to use a fifo queue where the semaphore  contains both head and tail pointers to the queue in general however the list  can use any queueing strategy correct usage of semaphores does not depend  on a particular queueing strategy for the semaphore lists  it is critical that semaphores be executed atomically we must guarantee  that no two processes can execute wait and signal operations on the  same semaphore at the same time this is a critical section problem and  in a single processor environment that is where only one cpu exists we  can solve it by simply inhibiting interrupts during the time the wait and  signal operations are executing this scheme works in a single processor  environment because once interrupts are inhibited instructions from different  processes cannot be interleaved only the currently running process executes  until interrupts are reenabled and the scheduler can regain control  in a multiprocessor environment interrupts must be disabled on every  processor otherwise instructions from different processes running on differ\\xad ent processors may be interleaved in some arbitrary way disabling interrupts  on every processor can be a difficult task and furthermore can seriously dimin\\xad ish performance therefore smp systems must provide alternative locking  techniques such as spinlocks to ensure that wait and signal are  performed atomically  it is important to admit that we have not completely eliminated busy  waiting with this definition of the wait and signal operations rather  we have moved busy waiting from the entry section to the critical sections  of application programs furthermore we have limited busy waiting to the  critical sections of the wait and signal opera times and these sections are  short if properly coded they sbould be no more than about ten instructions  thus the critical section is almost never occupied and busy waiting occurs  rarely and then for only a short time an entirely different situation exists  with application programs whose critical sections may be long minutes or   chapter  even hours or may almost always be occupied in such casesf busy waiting is  extremely inefficient   deadlocks and starvation  the implementation of a semaphore with a waiting queue may result in a  situation where two or more processes are waiting indefinitely for an event  that can be caused only by one of the waiting processes the event in question  is the execution of a signal when such a state is reached these  processes are said to be  to illustrate this we consider a system consisting of two processes po and  p each accessing two semaphores s and q set to the value  po  wait s  wait q  signal s  signal q pl  wait q  wait s  signal q  signal s  suppose that po executes wait s and then p executes wait q when po  executes wait q it must wait until p executes signal q similarly when  p executes wait s it must wait until po executes signal s since these  signal operations camot be executed po and p are deadlocked  we say that a set of processes is in a deadlock state when every process  in the set is waiting for an event that can be caused only by another process  in the set the events with which we are mainly concerned here are resource  acquisition and release however other types of events may result in deadlocks  as we show in chapter in that chapter we describe various mechanisms for  dealing with the deadlock problem  another problem related to deadlocks is or  a situation in which processes wait indefinitely within the semaphore  indefinite blocking may occur if we remove processes from the list associated  with a semaphore in lifo last in first out order   priority inversion  a scheduling challenge arises when a higher priority process needs to read  or modify kernel data that are currently being accessed by a lower priority  process or a chain of lower priority processes since kernel data are typically  protected with a lock the higher priority process will have to wait for a  lower priority one to finish with the resource the situation becomes more  complicated if the lower priority process is preempted in favor of another  process with a higher priority as an example assume we have three processes  lf m and h whose priorities follow the order l m h assume that  process h requires resource r which is currently being accessed by process l  ordinarily process h would wait for l to finish using resource r however  now suppose that process m becomes runnable thereby preempting process     priority inversion and the mars pathfinder  priority inversion can be more than a scheduling inconvenience on systems  with tight time constraints such as real time systems see chapter  priority inversion can cause a process to take longer than it should to  accomplish a task when that happens other failures can cascade resulting  in system failure  consider the mars pathfinder a nasa space probe that landed a robot the  sojourner rover on mars in to conduct experiments shortly after the  sojourner began operating it started to experience frequent computer resets  each reset reinitialized all hardware and software including communica\\xad tions if the problem had not been solved the sojourner would have failed in  its mission  the problem was caused by the fact that one high priority task bcdist  was taking longer than expected to complete its work this task was being  forced to wait for a shared resource that was held by the lower priority   asi met task which in turn was preempted by multiple medium priority  tasks the bcdist task would stall waiting for the shared resource and  ultimately the bc sched task would discover the problem and perform the  reset the sojourner was suffering from a typical case of priority inversion  the operating system on the sojourner was vxworks see section   which had a global variable to enable priority inheritance on all semaphores  after testing the variable was set on the sojourner on mars and the  problem was solved  a full description of the problem its detection and its solu\\xad tion was written by the software team lead and is available at  research microsoft com mbj marsyathfinder i authoritative account html  l indirectly a process with a lower priority process m has affected how  long process h must wait for l to relinquish resource r  this problem is known as it occurs only in systems with  more than two priorities so one solution is to have only two priorities that is  insufficient for most general purpose operating systems however typically  these systems solve the problem by implementing a tic x u   according to this protocol all processes that are accessing resources  needed by a higher priority process inherit the higher priority until they are  finished with the resources in question when they are finished their priorities  revert to their original values in the exan ple above a priority inheritance  protocol would allow process l to temporarily inherit the priority of process  h thereby preventing process m from preempting its execution when process  l had finished using resource r it would relinquish its inherited priority from  hand assume its original priority because resource r would now be available  process h not m would run next  in this section we present a

present a  general structure of this scheme without committing ourselves to any particular  implementation we provide a related programming project in the exercises at  the end of the chapter  we assume that the pool consists of n buffers each capable of holding  one item the mutex semaphore provides mutual exclusion for accesses to the  buffer pool and is initialized to the value the empty

the consumer or as the consumer producing empty  buffers for the producer  do  wait full  wait mutex  ii remove an item from buffer to nextc  signal mutex  signal empty  ii consume the item in nextc

only to read the database whereas others  may want to update that is to read and write the database we distinguish  between these two types of processes by referring to the former as readers  and to the latter as writers obviously if two readers access the shared data  simultaneously no adverse effects will result however if a writer and some  other process either a reader or a writer access the database simultaneously  chaos may ensue  to ensure that these difficulties do not arise we require that the writers  have exclusive access to the shared database while writing to the database this  synchronization problem is referred to as the readers writers problem since it  was originally stated it has been used to test nearly every new synchronization  primitive the readers writers problem has several variations all involving  priorities the simplest one referred to as the first readers writers problem  requires that no reader be kept waiting unless a writer has already obtained  permission to use the shared object in other words no reader should wait for  other readers to finish simply because a writer is waiting the second readers\\xad writers problem requires that once a writer is ready that writer performs its  write as soon as possible in other words if a writer is waiting to access the  object no new readers may start reading  a solution to either problem may result in starvation in the first case  writers may starve in the second case readers may starve for this reason  other variants of the problem have been proposed next we present a solution  to the first readers writers problem refer to the bibliographical notes at the  end of the chapter for references describing starvation free solutions to the  second readers writers problem  in the solution to the first readers writers problem the reader processes  share the following data structures  semaphore mutex wrt  int readcount  the semaphores mutex and wrt are initialized to readcount is initialized  to the semaphore wrt is common to both reader and writer processes  the mutex semaphore is used to ensure mutual exclusion when the variable  readcount is updated the readcount variable keeps track of how many  processes are currently reading the object the semaphore wrt functions as a  mutual exclusion semaphore for the writers it is also used by the first or last  reader that enters or exits the critical section it is not used by readers who  enter or exit while other readers are in their critical sections  the code for a writer process is shown in figure the code for a reader  process is shown in figure note that if a writer is in the critical section  and n readers are waiting then one reader is queued on wrt and n readers  are queued on mutex also observe that when a writer executes signal wrt  we may resume the execution of either the waiting readers or a single waiting  writer the selection is made by the scheduler  the readers writers problem and its solutions have been generalized to  provide locks on some systems acquiring a reader writer lock   chapter  do  wait wrt  ii writing is performed  signal wrt   while true  figure i the structure of a writer process  requires specifying the mode of the lock either read or write access when a  process wishes only to read shared data it requests the reader writer lock  in read mode a process wishing to modify the shared data must request the  lock in write mode multiple processes are permitted to concurrently acquire  a reader writer lock in read mode but only one process may acquire the lock  for writing as exclusive access is required for writers  reader writer locks are most useful in the following situations  in applications where it is easy to identify which processes only read shared  data and which processes only write shared data  in applications that have more readers than writers this is because reader\\xad writer locks generally require more overhead to establish than semaphores  or mutual exclusion locks the increased concurrency of allowing multiple  readers compensates for the overhead involved in setting up the reader\\xad writer lock   the dining philosophers

philosopher may pick  up only one chopstick at a time obviously she camot pick up a chopstick that  is already in the hand of a neighbor when a htmgry philosopher has both her  chopsticks at the same time she eats without releasing her chopsticks when  she is finished eating she puts down both of her chopsticks and starts thinking  again  the dining philosophers problem is considered a classic synchronization  problem neither because of its practical importance nor because computer  scientists dislike philosophers but because it is an example of a large class  of concurrency control problems it is a simple representation of the need  to allocate several resources among several processes in a deadlock free and  starvation free mamer  one simple solution is to represent each chopstick with a semaphore a  philosopher tries to grab a chopstick by executing await operation on that  semaphore she releases her chopsticks by executing the signal operation  on the appropriate semaphores thus the shared data are  semaphore chopstick  where all the elements of chopstick are initialized to the structure of  philosopher i is shown in figure  although this solution guarantees that no two neighbors are eating  simultaneously it nevertheless must be rejected because it could create a  deadlock suppose that all five philosophers become hungry simultaneously  and each grabs

section  use an asymmetric solution that is an odd philosopher picks up first her  left chopstick and then her right chopstick whereas an even philosopher  picks up her right chopstick and then her left chopstick  in section we present a solution to the dining philosophers problem  that ensures freedom from deadlocks note however that any satisfactory  solution to the dining philosophers problem must guard against the possibility  that one of the philosophers will starve to death a deadlock free solution does  not necessarily eliminate the possibility of starvation  although semaphores provide a convenient and effective mechanism for  process synchronization using them incorrectly can result in timing errors  that are difficult to detect since these errors happen only if some particular  execution sequences take place and these sequences do not always occur  we have seen an example of such errors in the use of counters in our  solution to the producer consumer problem section  in that example  the timing problem happened only rarely and even then the counter value  appeared to be reasonable off by only nevertheless the solution is  obviously not an acceptable one it is for this reason that semaphores were  introduced in the first place  unfortunately such timing errors can still occur when semaphores are  used to illustrate how we review the semaphore solution to the critical section  problem all processes share a semaphore variable mutex which is initialized  to each process must execute wait mutex before entering the critical section  and signal mutex afterward if this sequence is not observed two processes  may be in their critical sections simultaneously next we examine the various  difficulties that may result note that these difficulties will arise even if a  single process is not well behaved this situation may be caused by an honest  programming error or an uncooperative programmer    suppose that a process interchanges the order in which the wait and  signal operations on the semaphore mutex are executed resulting in  the following execution  signal mutex  critical section  wait mutex  in this situation several processes may be executing in their critical sections  simultaneously violating the mutual exclusion requirement this error  may be discovered only if several processes are simultaneously active  in their critical sections note that this situation may not always be  reproducible  suppose that a process replaces signal mutex with wait mutex that  is it executes  wait mutex  critical section  wait mutex  in this case a deadlock will occur  suppose that a process omits the wait mutex or the signal mutex or  both in this case either mutual exclusion is violated or a deadlock will  occur  these examples illustrate that various types of errors can be generated easily  when programmers use sencaphores incorrectly to solve the critical section  problem similar problems may arise in the other synchronization models  discussed in section  to deal with such errors researchers have developed high level language  constructs in this section we describe one fundamental high level synchro\\xad nization construct the monitor type   usage  a abstract data type or adt encapsulates private data with public methods  to operate on that data a monitor type is an adt which presents a set of  programmer defined operations that are provided mutual exclusion within  the monitor the monitor type also contains the declaration of variables whose  values define the state of an instance of that type along with the bodies of  procedures or functions that operate on those variables the syntax of a monitor  type is shown in figure the representation of a monitor type cannot be  used directly by the various processes thus a procedure defined within a  monitor can access only those variables declared locally within the monitor  and its formal parameters similarly the local variables of a monitor can be  accessed by only the local procedures   chapter  monitor rrwnitor name    ii shared variable declarations  procedure p       procedure p       procedure pn       initialization code         figure syntax of a monitor  the monitor construct ensures that only one process at a time is active  within the monitor consequently the programmer does not need to code  this synchronization constraint explicitly figure  however the monitor  construct as defined so far is not sufficiently powerful for modeling some  synchronization schemes for this purpose we need to define additional syn\\xad chronization mechanisms these mechanisms are provided by the condition  construct a programmer who needs to write a tailor made synchronization  scheme can define one or more variables of type condition  condition x y  the only operations that can be invoked on a condition variable are wait  and signal the operation  x wait  means that the process invoking this operation is suspended until another  process invokes  x signal  the x signal operation resumes exactly one suspended process if no  process is suspended then the signal operation has no effect that is the  state of x is the same as if the operation had never been executed figure  shared data  operations  initialization  code  figure schematic view of a monitor   contrast this operation with the signal operation associated with  semaphores which always affects the state of the semaphore  now suppose that when the x signal operation is invoked by a process  p there exists a suspended process q associated with condition x clearly if the  suspended process q is allowed to resume its execution the signaling process p  must wait otherwise both p and q would be active simultaneously within the  monitor note however that both processes can conceptually continue with  their execution two possibilities exist  signal and wait p either waits until q leaves the monitor or waits for  another condition  signal and continue q either waits until p leaves the monitor or waits  for another condition  there are reasonable arguments in favor of adopting either option on the  one hand since p was already executing in the monitor the signal and continue  method seems more reasonable on the other hand if we allow thread p to  continue then by the time q is resumed the logical condition for which q  was waiting may no longer hold a compromise between these two choices  was adopted in the language concurrent pascal when thread p executes the  signal operation it imncediately leaves the monitor hence q is immediately  resumed  many programming languages have incorporated the idea of the monitor  as described in this section including concurrent pascal mesa c pro\\xad nounced c sharp and java other languages such as erlang provide some  type of concurrency support using a similar mechanism   chapter  queues associated with  x y conditions         operations  initialization  code  figure monitor with condition variables   dining philosophers solution using monitors  next we illustrate monitor concepts by presenting a deadlock free solution to  the dining philosophers problem this solution imposes the restriction that a  philosopher may pick up her chopsticks only if both of them are available to  code this solution we need to distinguish among three states in which we may  find a philosopher for this purpose we introduce the following data structure  enum thinking hungry eating state  philosopher i can set the variable state i eating only if her two  neighbors are not eating state i   eating and state i    eating  we also need to declare  condition sel£  in which philosopher i can delay herself when she is hungry but is unable to  obtain the chopsticks she needs  we are now in a position to describe our solution to the dining philosophers  problem the distribution of the chopsticks is controlled by the monitor din\\xad ingphilosophers whose definition is shown in figure each philosopher  before starting to eat must invoke the operation pickup this act n lay result  in the suspension of the philosopher process after the successful completion of  the operation the philosopher may eat following this the philosopher invokes    monitor dp     enum thinking hungry eating state  condition self  void pickup int i  state i hungry  test i   if state i  eating  self i wait   void putdown int i  state i thinking  test i    test i      void test int i   if state i   eating    state i hungry    state i   eating   state i eating  self i signal  initialization code    for int i  i  i  state i thinking  figure a monitor solution to the dining philosopher problem  the put down operation thus philosopher i must invoke the operations  pickup and put down in the following sequence  diningphilosophers pickup i  eat  diningphilosophers putdown i  it is easy to show that this solution ensures that no two neighbors are eating  simultaneously and that no deadlocks will occur we note however that it is  possible for a philosopher to starve to death we do not present a solution to  this problem but rather leave it as an exercise for you   chapter   implementing a monitor using semaphores  we now consider a possible implementation of the nwnitor mechanism using  semaphores for each ltlonitor a semaphore mutex initialized to is provided  a process must execute wait mutex before entering the nonitor and must  execute signal mutex after leaving the monitor  since a signaling process must wait until the resumed process either leaves  or waits an additional sernaphore next is introduced initialized to the  signaling processes can use next to suspend themselves an integer variable  next count is also provided to count the number of processes suspended on  next thus each external procedure f is replaced by  wait mutex  body off  if next count   signal next  else  signal mutex  mutual exclusion within a monitor is ensured  we can now describe how condition variables are implemented as well  for each condition x we introduce a semaphore x sem and an integer  variable x count both initialized to the operation x wait can now be  implemented as  x count  if next count   signal next  else  signal mutex  wait x sem  x count  the operation x signal can be implemented as  if x count   next count  signal x sem  wait next  next count    this implementation is applicable to the definitions of monitors given by  both hoare and brinch hansen in some cases however the generality of the  implementation is unnecessary and a significant improvement in efficiency is  possible we leave this problem to you in exercise   resuming processes within a monitor  we turn now to the subject of process resumption order within a monitor if  several processes are suspended on condition x and an x signal operation  monitor resourceallocator     boolean busy  condition x  void acquire int time  if busy  x wait time  busy true    void release   busy false  x signal     initialization code   busy false    figure a monitor to allocate a single resource  is executed by some process then how do we determine which of the  suspended processes should be resumed next one simple solution is to use an  fcfs ordering so that the process that has been waiting the longest is resumed  first in many circumstances however such a simple scheduling scheme is not  adequate for this purpose the construct can be used it has  the form  x wait c  where c is an integer expression that is evaluated when the wait operation  is executed the value of c which is called a pdos ty is then stored  with the name of the process that is suspended when x signal is executed  the process with the smallest priority number is resumed next  to illustrate this new mechanism consider the resourceallocator mon\\xad itor shown in figure which controls the allocation of a single resource  among competing processes each process when requesting an allocation of  this resource specifies the maximum time it plans to use the resource the mon\\xad itor allocates the resource to the process that has the shortest time allocation  request a process that needs to access the resource in question must observe  the following sequence  r acquire t  access the resource  r release   where r is an instance of type resourceallocator   chapter   unfortunately the monitor concept cannot guarantee that the preceding  access sequence will be observed in particular the following problems can  occur  a process might access a resource without first gaining access permission  to the resource  a process ntight never release a resource once it has been granted access  to the resource  a process might attempt to release a resource that it never requested  a process might request the same resource twice without first releasing  the resource  the same difficulties are encountered with the use of semaphores and  these difficulties are similar in nature to those that encouraged us to develop  the monitor constructs in the first place previously we had to worry about  the correct use of semaphores now we have to worry about the correct use of  higher level programmer defined operations with which the compiler can no  longer assist us  one possible solution to the current problem is to include the resource\\xad access operations within the resourceallocator monitor however using  this solution will mean that scheduling is done according to the built in  monitor scheduling algorithm rather than the one we have coded  to ensure that the processes observe the appropriate sequences we must  inspect all the programs that make use of the resourceallocator monitor  and its managed resource we must check two conditions to establish the  correctness of this system first user processes must always make their calls  on the monitor in a correct sequence second we must be sure that an  uncooperative process does not simply ignore the mutual exclusion gateway  provided by the monitor and try to access the shared resource directly without  using the access protocols only if these two conditions can be ensured can we  guarantee that no time dependent errors will occur and that the scheduling  algorithm will not be defeated  although this inspection may be possible for a small static system it is  not reasonable for a large system or a dynamic system this access control  problem can be solved only through the use of additional mechanisms that are  described in chapter  many programming languages have incorporated the idea of the monitor  as described in this section including concurrent pascal mesa c pro\\xad nounced c sharp and java other languages such as erlang provide some  type of concurrency support using a similar mechanism  we next describe the synchronization mechanisms provided by the solaris  windows xp and linux operating systems as well as the pthreads api we have  chosen these three operating systems because they provide good examples of  different approaches for synchronizing the kernel and we have included the    java monitors  java provides a monitor like concurrency mechanisn for thread synchro\\xad nization every object in java has associated with it a single lock when a  method is declared to be synchronized calling the method requires owning  the lock for the object we declare a synchronized method by placing the  synchronized keyword in the method definition the following defines the  safemethod as synchronized for example  public class simpleclass   public synchronized void safemethod   i implementation of safemethod i    next assume we create an object instance of simpleclass such as  simpleclass sc new simpleclass  invoking the sc safemethod method requires owning the lock on the  object instance sc if the lock is already owned by another thread the thread  calling the synchronized method blocks and is placed in the entry set for the  object s lock the entry set represents the set of threads waiting for the lock  to become available if the lock is available when a synchronized method  is called the calling thread becomes the owner of the object s lock and can  enter the method the lock is released when the thread exits the method a  thread from the entry set is then selected as the new owner of the lock  java also provides wait and notify methods which are similar  in function to the wait and signal statements for a monitor release   of the java language provides api support for semaphores condition  variables and mutex locks among other concurrency mechanisms in the  java util concurrent package  pthreads api because it is widely used for thread creation and synchronization  by developers on unix and linux systems as you will see in this section the  synchronization methods available in these differing systems vary in subtle  and significant ways   synchronization in solaris  to control access to critical sections solaris provides adaptive mutexes condi\\xad tion variables sernaphores reader writer locks and turnstiles solaris imple\\xad ments semaphores and condition variables essentially as they are presented  in sections and in this section we describe adaptive mlltexes reader\\xad writer locks and turnstiles   chapter  an protects access to every critical data item on a  multiprocessor system an adaptive mutex starts as a standard semaphore  implemented as a spinlock if the data are locked and therefore already in use  the adaptive mutex does one of two things if the lock is held by a thread that  is currently running on another cpu the thread spins while waiting for the  lock to become available because the thread holding the lock is likely to finish  soon if the thread holding the lock is not currently in run state the thread  blocks going to sleep until it is awakened by the release of the lock it is put  to sleep so that it will not spin while waiting since the lock will not be freed  very soon a lock held by a sleeping thread is likely to be in this category on  a single processor system the thread holding the lock is never rwming if the  lock is being tested by another thread because only one thread can run at a  time therefore on this type of system threads always sleep rather than spin  if they encounter a lock  solaris uses the adaptive mutex method to protect only data that are  accessed by short code segments that is a mutex is used if a lock will be  held for less than a few hundred instructions if the code segment is longer  than that the spin waiting method is exceedingly inefficient for these longer  code segments condition variables and semaphores are used if the desired  lock is already held the thread issues a wait and sleeps when a thread frees  the lock it issues a signal to the next sleeping thread in the queue the extra  cost of putting a thread to sleep and waking it and of the associated context  switches is less than the cost of wasting several hundred instructions waiting  in a spinlock  reader writer locks are used to protect data that are accessed frequently  but are usually accessed in a read only manner in these circumstances  reader writer locks are more efficient than semaphores because multiple  threads can read data concurrently whereas semaphores always serialize access  to the data reader writer locks are relatively expensive to implement so again  they are used only on long sections of code  solaris uses turnstiles to order the list of threads waiting to acquire either  an adaptive n utex or a reader writer lock a is a queue structure  containing threads blocked on a lock for example if one thread currently  owns the lock for a synchronized object all other threads trying to acquire the  lock will block and enter the turnstile for that lock when the lock is released  the kernel selects a thread from the turnstile as the next owner of the lock  each synchronized object with at least one thread blocked on the object s lock  requires a separate turnstile however rather than associating a turnstile with  each synchronized object solaris gives each kernel thread its own turnstile  because a thread can be blocked only on one object at a time this is more  efficient than having a turnstile for each object  the turnstile for the first thread to block on a synchronized object becomes  the turnstile for the object itself threads subsequently blocking on the lock will  be added to this turnstile when the initial thread ultimately releases the lock  it gains a new turnstile from a list of free turnstiles maintained by the kernel to  prevent a priority inversion turnstiles are organized according to a priority\\xad inheritance protocol this means that if a lower priority thread currently holds  a lock on which a higher priority thread is blocked the thread with the lower  priority will temporarily inherit the priority of the higher priority thread upon  releasing the lock the thread will revert to its original priority    note that the locking mechanisms used by the kernel are implemented  for user level threads as well so the same types of locks are available inside  and outside the kernel a crucial implementation difference is the priority\\xad inheritance protocol kernel locking routines adhere to the kernel priority\\xad inheritance methods used by the scheduler as described in section  user level thread locking mechanisms do not provide this functionality  to optimize solaris performance developers have refined and fine tuned  the locking methods because locks are used frequently and typically are used  for crucial kernel functions tuning their implem entation and use can produce  great performance gains   synchronization in windows xp  the windows xp operating system is a multithreaded kernel that provides  support for real time applications and multiple processors when the windows  xp kernel accesses a global resource on a uniprocessor system it temporarily  masks interrupts for all interrupt handlers that may also access the global  resource on a multiprocessor system windows xp protects access to global  resources using spinlocks just as in solaris the kernel uses spinlocks only to  protect short code segments furthermore for reasons of efficiency the kernel  ensures that a thread will never be preempted while holding a spinlock  for thread synchronization outside the kernel windows xp provides    using a dispatcher object threads synchronize according  to several different mechanisms including mutexes semaphores events and  timers the system protects shared data by requiring a tluead to gain ownership  of a mutex to access the data and to release ownership when it is finished  semaphores behave as described in section are similar to condition  variables that is they may notify a waiting thread when a desired condition  occurs finally timers are used to notify one or more than one thread that a  specified amount of time has expired  dispatcher objects may be in either a signaled state or a nonsignaled state  a si§ led indicates that an object is available and a thread will not block  when acquiring the object a indicates that an object is not  available and a thread will block when attempting to acquire the object we  illustrate the state transitions of a mutex lock dispatcher object in figure  a relationship exists between the state of a dispatcher object and the state  of a thread when a thread blocks on a nonsignaled dispatcher object its state  changes frmn ready to waiting and the thread is placed in a waiting queue  for that object when the state for the dispatcher object moves to signaled  the kernel checks whether any threads are waiting on the object if so the  owner thread releases mutex lock  thread acquires mutex lock  figure mutex dispatcher object   chapter  kernel moves one thread or possibly nlore threads from the waiting state  to the ready state where they can resume executing the number of threads  the kernel selects from the waiting queue depends on the type of dispatcher  object for which it is waiting the kernel will select only one thread from the  waiting queue for a mutex since a mutex object may be owned by only a  single thread for an event object the kernel will select all threads that are  waiting for the event  we can use a mutex lock as an illustration of dispatcher objects and  thread states if a thread tries to acquire a mutex dispatcher object that is in a  nonsignaled state that thread will be suspended and placed in a waiting queue  for the mutex object when the mutex moves to the signaled state because  another thread has released the lock on the mutex the thread waiting at the  front of the queue will be moved from the waiting state to the ready state and  will acquire the mutex lock  we provide a programming project at the end of this chapter that uses  mutex locks and semaphores in the win api   synchronization in linux  prior to version linux was a nonpreemptive kernel meaning that a process  running in kernel mode could not be preempted even if a higher priority  process became available to run now however the linux kernel is fully  preemptive so a task can be preempted when it is running in the kernel  the linux kernel provides spinlocks and semaphores as well as reader\\xad writer versions of these two locks for locking in the kernel on smp machines  the fundamental locking mechanism is a spinlock and the kernel is designed so  that the spinlock is held only for short durations on single processor machines  spinlocks are inappropriate for use and are replaced by enabling and disabling  kernel preemption that is on single processor machines rather than holding  a spinlock the kernel disables kernel preemption and rather than releasing  the spinlock it enables kernel preemption this is summarized below  disable kernel preemption acquirespin lock  enable kernel preemption release spin lock  linux uses an interesting approach to disable and enable kernel preemp\\xad tion it provides two simple system calls preempldisable and pre\\xad empt enable for disabling and enabling kernel preemption in addition  however the kernel is not preemptible if a kernel mode task is holding a lock  to enforce this rule each task irl the system has a thread info structure  containing a counter preemplcount to indicate the number of locks being  held by the task when a lock is acquired preemplcount is incremented it  is decremented when a lock is released if the value of preempt count for the  task currently running is greater than zero it is not safe to preempt the kernel  as this task currently holds a lock if the count is zero the kernel can safely be  interrupted assuncing there are no outstanding calls to preempldisable      spinlocks along with enabling and disabling kernel preemption are  used in the kernel only when a lock or disabling kernel preemption is held  for a short duration when a lock must be held for a longer period semaphores  are appropriate for use   synchronization in pthreads  the pthreads api provides mutex locks condition variables and read write  locks for thread synchronization this api is available for programmers and  is not part of any particular kernel mutex locks represent the fundamental  synchronization technique used with pthreads a mutex lock is used to protect  critical sections of code that is a thread acquires the lock before entering  a critical section and releases it upon exiting the critical section condition  variables in pthreads behave much as described in section read write  locks behave similarly to the locking mechanism described in section   many systems that implement pthreads also provide semaphores although  they are not part of the pthreads standard and instead belong to the posix sem  extension other extensions to the pthreads api include spinlocks but not all  extensions are considered portable from one implementation to another we  provide a programming project at the end of this chapter that uses pthreads  mutex locks and semaphores  the mutual exclusion of critical sections ensures that the critical sections are  executed atomically that is as one uninterruptible unit if two critical sections  are instead executed concurrently the result is equivalent to their sequential  execution in some unknown order although this property is useful in many  application domains in many cases we would like to make sure that a critical  section forms a single logical unit of work that either is performed in its entirety  or is not performed at all an example is funds transfer in which one account  is debited and another is credited clearly it is essential for data consistency  either that both the credit and debit occur or that neither occurs  consistency of data along with storage and retrieval of data is a concern  often associated with recently there has been an upsurge of  interest in using database systems techniques in operating systems operating  systems can be viewed as manipulators of data as such they can benefit from  the advanced techniques and models available from database research for  instance many of the ad hoc techniques used in operating systems to manage  files could be more flexible and powerful if more formal database methods  were used in their place in sections to  we describe some of these  database techniques and explain how they can be used by operating systems  first however we deal with the general issue of transaction atomicity it is this  property that the database techniques are meant to address   system model  a collection of instructions or operations that performs a single logical  function is called a a major issue in processing transactions is the   chapter  preservation of atomicity despite the possibility of failures within the computer  system  we can think of a transaction as a program unit that accesses and perhaps  updates various data items that reside on a disk within some files from our  point of view such a transaction is simply a sequence of read and write  operations terminated by either a commit operation or an abort operation  a commit operation signifies that the transaction has terminated its execution  successfully whereas an abort operation signifies that the transaction has  transactional memory  with the emergence of multicore systems has come increased pressure to  develop multithreaded applications that take advantage of multiple process\\xad ing cores however multithreaded applications present an increased risk  of race conditions and deadlocks traditionally techniques such as locks  semaphores and monitors have been used to address these issues how\\xad ever provides an alternative strategy fordeveloping  thread safe concurrent applications  a is a sequence of memory read write operations  that are atomic if all operations in a transaction are completed the memory  transaction is committed otherwise the operations must be aborted and  rolled back the benefits of transactional memory can be obtained through  features added to a programming language  consider an example suppose we have a function update that  modifies shared data traditionally this function would be written using  locks such as the following  update   acquire   i modify shared data i  release  however using synchronization mechanisms such as locks and semaphores  involves many potential problems including deadlocks additionally as the  number of threads increases traditional locking does not scale well  as an alternative to traditional methods new features that take advantage  of transactional memory can be added to a programming language in our  example suppose we add the construct atomic s which ensures that  the operations in s execute as a transaction this allows us to rewrite the  update method as follows  update   atomic  i modify shared data i      continued on following page    transactional memory continued  the advantage of using such a mechanism rather than locks is that the  transactional memoi y system not the developer isrespon sible for guar\\xad anteeing atomicity additionally the system can identify which statements in  atomic blocks can be executed concurrently such as concurrent read access to  a shared variable it is of course possible for a programmer to identify these  situations and use reader writer locks but the task becomes increasingly  difficult as the number ofthreads within anapplicationgrows  transactional memory can be implemented in either software or hard\\xad ware software transactional memory stm as the nam suggests imp lee  ments transactional memory exclusivelyin software nospecial hardware  is needed stm works by inserting instrumentation code inside transaction  blocks the code is inserted by a compiler and manages each transaction by  examining where statements may run concurrently and where specific low\\xad levellockingis required hardware transactional memory small htm uses  hardware cache hierarchies and cache coherency protocols to manage and  resolve conflicts involving shared data residing in separate processors caches  htm requires no special code instmmentation and thus has less overhead  than stm however htm does require that existing cache hierarchies and  cachecoherencyprotocolsbe modified to support transactional memory  transactional memory has existed for several years without widespread  implementation however the growth of multi core systems and the asso\\xad ciated emphasis on concurrent programming have prompted a significant  amolmt ofresearch in this area on the part of both academics and hard ware  vendors including intel and sun microsystems  ended its normal execution due to some logical error or a system failure  if a terminated transaction has completed its execution successfully it is  otherwise it is  since an aborted transaction may already have modified the data that it  has accessed the state of these data may not be the same as it would have  been if the transaction had executed atomically so that atomicity is ensured  an aborted transaction must have no effect on the state of the data that it has  already modified thus the state of the data accessed by an aborted transaction  must be restored to what it was just before the transaction started executing we  say that such a transaction has been it is part of the responsibility  of the system to ensure this property  to determ ine how the system should ensure atomicity we need first to  identify the properties of devices used for storing the various data accessed  by the transactions various types of storage media are distinguished by their  relative speed capacity and resilience to failure  volatile storage information residing in volatile storage does not usually  survive system crashes examples of such storage are main and cache  merrwry access to volatile storage is extremely fast both because of the  speed of the memory access itself and because it is possible to access  directly any data item in volatile storage   chapter  nonvolatile storage information residing in nonvolatile storage usually  survives system crashes examples of m edia for such storage are disks and  magnetic tapes disks are more reliable than main memory but less reliable  than magnetic tapes both disks and tapes however are subject to failure  which may result in loss of inform ation currently nonvolatile storage is  slower than volatile storage by several orders of magnitude becmse disk  and tape devices are electromechanical and require physical motion to  access data  stable storage information residing in stable storage is never lost never  should be taken with a grain of salt since theoretically such absolutes  cannot be guaranteed to implement an approximation of such storage we  need to replicate information in several nonvolatile storage caches usually  disk with independent failure modes and to update the inform ation in a  controlled manner section   here we are concerned only with ensuring transaction atomicity in an  environment where failures result in the loss of inform ation on volatile storage   log based recovery  one way to ensure atomicity is to record on stable storage information  describing all the modifications made by the transaction to the various data it  accesses the most widely used method for achieving this form of recording  is here the system maintains on stable storage a data  structure called the each log record describes a single operation of a  transaction write and has the following fields  transaction name the unique name of the transaction that performed the  write operation  data item name the unique name of the data item written  old value the value of the data item prior to the write operation  new value the value that the data item will have after the write  other special log records exist to record significant events during transac\\xad tion processing such as the start of a transaction and the commit or abort of a  transaction  before a transaction t starts its execution the record t starts is  written to the log during its execution any write operation by t is preceded  by the writing of the appropriate new record to the log when t commits the  record t commits is written to the log  because the information in the log is used in reconstructing the state of the  data items accessed by the various transactions we cannot allow the actual  update to a data item to take place before the corresponding log record is  written out to stable storage we therefore require that prior to execution of a  wri te x operation the log records corresponding to x be written onto stable  storage  note the performance penalty inherent in this system two physical writes  are required for every logical write requested also more storage is needed  both for the data themselves and for the log recording the changes in cases    where the data are extremely important and fast failure recovery is necessary  however the functionality is worth tle price  using the log the system can handle any failure that does not result in the  loss of information on nonvolatile storage the recovery algorithm uses two  procedures  undo t  which restores the value of all data updated by transaction t to  the old values  redo t  which sets the value of all data updated by transaction t to the  new values  the set of data updated by t and the appropriate old and new values can be  found in the log note that the undo and redo operations must be idempotent   that is multiple executions must have the same result as does one execution to  guarantee correct behavior even if a failure occurs during the recovery process  if a transaction t aborts then we can restore the state of the data that  it has updated by simply executing undo t  if a system failure occurs we  restore the state of all updated data by consulting the log to determine which  transactions need to be redone and which need to be lmdone this classification  of transactions is accomplished as follows  transaction t needs to be undone if the log contains the i starts  record but does not contain the t corrnni ts record  transaction t needs to be redone if the log contains both the t starts  and the t corrnni ts records   checkpoints  when a system failure occurs we must consult the log to determine which  transactions need to be redone and which need to be undone in principle we  need to search the entire log to make these determinations there are two major  drawbacks to this approach  the searching process is time consuming  most of the transactions that according to our algorithm need to be  redone have already actually updated the data that the log says they  need to modify although redoing the data modifications will cause no  harm due to idempotency it will nevertheless cause recovery to take  longer  to reduce these types of overhead we introduce the concept of  during execution the system maintains the write ahead log in addi\\xad tion the system periodically performs checkpoints that require the following  sequence of actions to take place  output all log records currently residing in volatile storage usually main  memory onto stable storage  output all modified data residing in volatile storage to the stable storage  output a log record checkpoint onto stable storage   chapter  the presence of a checkpoint record in the log allows the systen l  to streamline its recovery procedure consider a transaction i that committed  prior to the checkpoint the t commits record appears in the log before the   checkpoint record any modifications made by t must have been written  to stable storage either prior to the checkpoint or as part of the checkpoint  itself thus at recovery time there is no need to perform a redo operation  on t  this observation allows us to refine our previous recovery algorithm after  a failure has occurred the recovery routine examines the log to determine  the most recent transaction t that started executing before the most recent  checkpoint took place it finds such a transaction by searching the log backward  to find the first checkpoint record and then finding the subsequent   t start record  once transaction t has been identified the redo and undo operations need  be applied only to transaction t and all transactions t that started executing  after transaction we ll call these transactions set t the remainder of the log  can be ignored the recovery operations that are required are as follows  for all transactions nc in t for which the record tic commits appears in  the log execute redo for all transactions nc in t that have no tic commits record in the log  execute undo  concurrent atomic transactions  we have been considering an environment in which only one transaction can  be executing at a time we now turn to the case where multiple transactions  are active simultaneously because each transaction is atomic the concurrent  execution of transactions must be equivalent to the case where these trans\\xad actions are executed serially in some arbih·ary order this property called  can be maintained by simply executing each transaction within  a critical section that is all transactions share a common semaphore mutex  which is initialized to when a transaction starts executing its first action is to  execute wai t mutex after the transaction either commits or aborts it executes  signal mutex  although this scheme ensures the atomicity of all concurrently executing  transactions it is nevertheless too restrictive as we shall see in many  cases we can allow transactions to overlap their execution while maintaining  serializability a number of different ensure  serializability and we describe these algorithms next   serializability  consider a system with two data items a and b that are both read and written  by two transactions to and t suppose that these transactions are executed  atomically in the order t followed by t this execution sequence which is  called a schedule is represented in figure in schedule of figure the  sequence of instruction steps is in chronological order from top to bottom with  instructions of to appearing in the left column and instructions of t appearing  in the right colunm    to t  read a  write a  read b  write b  read a  write a  read b  write b  figure schedule i a serial schedule in which to is followed by t•  a schedule in which each transaction is executed atomically is called  a a serial schedule consists of a sequence of instructions  from various transactions wherein the instructions belonging to a particular  transaction appear together thus for a set of n transactions there exist n  different valid serial schedules each serial schedule is correct because it is  equivalent to the atomic execution of the various participating transactions in  some arbitrary order  if we allow the two transactions to overlap their execution then the result\\xad ing schedule is no longer serial a •cj sef i al does not necessarily  imply an incorrect execution that is an execution that is not equivalent to one  represented by a serial schedule to see that this is the case we need to define  the notion of nflic cing  consider a schedule s in which there are two consecutive operations  and oi of transactions and ti respectively we say that and oj conflict if  they access the same data item and at least one of them is a write operation  to illustrate the concept of conflicting operations we consider the nonserial  schedule of figure the wri te a operation of to conflicts with the  read a operation of t however the wri te a operation of t does not  conflict with the read b operation of to because the two operations access  different data items  to t  read a  write a  read a  write a  read b  write b  read b  write b  figure schedule a concurrent serializable schedule   chapter  let and be consecutive operations of a schedule if and oi are  operations of different transactions and and oi do not conflict then we can  swap the order of and to produce a new schedule we expect to be  equivalent to as all operations appear in the same order in both schedules  except for and whose order does not matter  we can illustrate the swapping idea by considering again schedule of  figure as the wri te a operation of t does not conflict with the read b  operation of t we can swap these operations to generate an equivalent  schedule regardless of the initial system state both schedules produce  the same final system state continuing with this procedure of swapping  nonconflicting operations we get  swap the read b operation of to with the read a operation of t  swap the write b operation of to with the write a operation of t  swap the wri te b operation of to with the read a operation of t  the final result of these swaps is schedule in figure which is a  serial schedule thus we have shown that schedule is equivalent to a serial  schedule this result implies that regardless of the initial system state schedule   will produce the same final state as will some serial schedule  if a schedule can be transformed into a serial schedule  swaps of nonconflicting operations we say that a schedule is  izable thus schedule is conflict serializable because it can be transformed  into the serial schedule   locking protocol  one way to ensure serializability is to associate a lock with each data item and  to require that each transaction follow a that governs how  locks are acquired and released there are various modes in which a data item  can be locked in this section we restrict our attention to two modes  shared if a transaction i has obtained a shared mode lock denoted by  s on data item q then i can read this item but cannot write q  exclusive if a transaction t has obtained an exclusive mode lock denoted  by x on data item q then i can both read and write q  we require that every transaction request a lock in an appropriate m ode on  data item q depending on the type of operations it will perform on q  to access data item q transaction i must first lock q in the appropriate  mode if q is not currently locked then the lock is granted and t can now  access it however if the data item q is currently locked by some other  transaction then t may have to wait more specifically suppose that i requests  an exclusive lock on q in this case i must wait until the lock on q is released  if t requests a shared lock on q then t must wait if q is locked in exclusive  mode otherwise it can obtain the lock and access q notice that this scheme  is quite similar to the readers writers algorithm discussed in section   a transaction may unlock a data item that it locked at an earlier point  it must however hold a lock on a data item as long as it accesses that item    moreover it is not always desirable for a transaction to unlock a data item  immediately after its last access of that data item because serializability may  not be ensured  one protocol that ensures serializability is the  this protocol requires that each transaction issue lock and unlock requests in  two phases  growing phase a transaction may obtain locks but may not release any  locks  shrinking phase a transaction may release locks but may not obtain any  new locks  initially a transaction is in the growing phase the transaction acquires locks  as needed once the transaction releases a lock it enters the shrinking phase  and no more lock requests can be issued  the two phase locking protocol ensures conflict serializability exercise   it does not however ensure freedom from deadlock in addition it  is possible that for a given set of transactions there are conflict serializable  schedules that cannot be obtained by use of the two phase locking protocol  to improve performance over two phase locking we need either to have  additional information about the transactions or to impose some structure  or ordering on the set of data   timestamp based protocols  in the locking protocols described above the order followed by pairs of  conflicting transactions is determined at execution time another method for  determining the serializability order is to select an order in advance the most  common method for doing so is to use a ordering scheme  with each transaction in the system we associate a unique fixed  timestamp denoted by ts t this timestamp is assigned by the system  before the transaction t starts execution if a transaction has been assigned  timestamp ts  and later a new transaction ti enters the system then ts t   ts tj there are two simple methods for implementing this scheme  use the value of the system clock as the timestamp that is a transaction s  timestamp is equal to the value of the clock when the transaction enters the  system this method will not work for transactions that occur on separate  systems or for processors that do not share a clock  use a logical counter as the timestamp that is a transaction s timestamp  is equal to the value of the counter when the transaction enters the system  the counter is incremented after a new timestamp is assigned  the timestamps of the transactions determine the serializability order  thus if ts ti ts tj then the system must ensure that the schedule  produced is equivalent to a serial schedule in which transaction appears  before transaction tj  to implement this scheme we associate with each data item q two  timestamp values   chapter  w timestamp q denotes the largest timestamp of any transaction that  successfully executed wri te q  r timestamp q denotes the largest timestamp of any transaction that  successfully executed read q  these timestamps are updated whenever a new read q or wri te q instruc\\xad tion is executed  the timestamp ordering protocol ensures that any conflicting read and  write operations are executed in timestamp order this protocol operates as  follows  suppose that transaction t issues read q  o if ts ti w timestamp then t needs to read a value of q that was  already overwritten hence the read operation is rejected and t is  rolled back  o if ts t  w timestamp q then the read operation is executed and  r timestamp q is set to the maximum of r timestamp q and ts t  suppose that transaction t issues wri te q  o if ts t  r timestamp q then the value of q that t is producing  was needed previously and t assumed that this value would never be  produced hence the write operation is rejected and t is rolled back  o if ts t  w timestamp q then t is attempting to write an obsolete  value of q hence this write operation is rejected and t is rolled back  o otherwise the write operation is executed  a transaction t that is rolled back as a result of either a read or write operation  is assigned a new timestamp and is restarted  to illustrate this protocol consider schedule in figure which includes  transactions t and t we assume that a transaction is assigned a timestamp  immediately before its first instruction thus in schedule ts t ts t  and the schedule is possible under the timestamp protocol  this execution can also be produced by the two phase locking protocol  however some schedules are possible under the two phase locking protocol  but not under the timestamp protocol and vice versa  t t  read b  read b  write b  read a  read a  write a  figure schedule a schedule possible under the timestamp protocol    the timestamp protocol ensures conflict serializability this capability  follows from the fact that conflicting operations are processed in timestamp  order the protocol also ensures freedom fron deadlocl because no transaction  ever waits  given a collection of cooperating sequential processes that share data mutual  exclusion must be provided to ensure that a critical section of code is used  by only one process or thread at a tince typically computer hardware  provides several operations that ensure mutual exclusion however such  hardware based solutions are too complicated for most developers to use  semaphores overcome this obstacle semaphores can be used to solve various  synchronization problems and can be implemented efficiently especially if  hardware support for atomic operations is available  various synchronization problems such as the bounded buffer problem  the readers writers problem and the dining philosophers problem are impor\\xad tant mainly because they are examples of a large class of concurrency control  problems these problems are used to test nearly every newly proposed  synchronization scheme  the operating system must provide the means to guard against timing  errors several language constructs have been proposed to deal with these prob\\xad lems monitors provide the synchronization mechanism for sharing abstract  data types a condition variable provides a method by which a monitor  procedure can block its execution until it is signaled to continue  operating systems also provide support for synchronization for example  solaris windows xp and linux provide mechanisms such as semaphores  mutexes spinlocks and condition variables to control access to shared data  the pthreads api provides support for mutexes and condition variables  a transaction is a program unit that must be executed atomically that  is either all the operations associated with it are executed to completion or  none are performed to ensure atomicity despite system failure we can use a  write ahead log all updates are recorded on the log which is kept in stable  storage if a system crash occurs the information in the log is used in restoring  the state of the updated data items which is accomplished by use of the undo  and redo operations to reduce the overhead in searching the log after a system  failure has occurred we can use a checkpoint scheme  to ensure serializability when the execution of several transactions over\\xad laps we must use a concurrency control scheme various concurrency control  schemes ensure serializability by delaying an operation or aborting the trans\\xad action that issued the operation the most common ones are locking protocols  and timestamp ordering schemes   the first known

we will design a programming solution to the bounded buffer problem  using the producer and consumer processes shown in figures and   the solution presented in section uses three semaphores  empty and full which count the number of empty and full slots in the  buffer and mutex which is a binary or mutual exclusion semaphore  that protects the actual insertion or removal of items in the buffer for  this project standard counting semaphores will be used for empty and  full and a mutex lock rather than a binary semaphore will be used  to represent mutex the producer and consumer running as separate  threads will move items to and from a buffer that is synchronized with  these empty full and mutex structures you can solve this problem  using either pthreads or the win api  the buffer  internally the buffer will consist of a fixed size array of type  buffer i tern which will be defined using a typedef the array of  buffer i tern objects will be manipulated as a circular queue the  definition of buffer i tern along with the size of the buffer can be  stored in a header file such as the following  i buffer h i  typedef int buffer item   define buffer size  the buffer will be manipulated with two functions insert i tern and  remove i tern which are called by the producer and consumer threads  respectively a skeleton outlining these functions appears in figure   include buffer h  i the buffer i  buffer item buffer buffer size  int insert item buffer item item  i insert item into buffer  return if successful otherwise  return indicating an error condition i    int remove item buffer item item   i remove an object from buffer  placing it in item  return if successful otherwise  return indicating an error condition i  figure a skeleton program  the insert item and remove item functions will synchronize  the producer and consumer using the algorithms outlined in figures   and the buffer will also require an initialization function that  initializes the mutual exclusion object mutex along with the empty and  full semaphores  the main f lmction will initialize the buffer and create the separate  producer and consumer threads once it has created the producer  and consumer threads the main function will sleep for a period of  time and upon awakening will terminate the application the main  function will be passed three parameters on the command line  a how long to sleep before terminating  b the number of producer threads  c the nuncber of consumer threads  a skeleton for this function appears in figure   include buffer h  int main int argc

producer and consumer threads  the producer thread will alternate between sleeping for a random period  of time and inserting a random integer into the buffer random numbers  will be produced using the rand function which produces random  integers between and rand max the consumer will also sleep for a  random period of time and upon awakening will attempt to remove an  item from the buffer an outline of the producer and consumer threads  appears in figure  in the following sections we first cover details specific to pthreads  and then describe details of the win api  pthreads thread

code sample  pthreads mutex locks  the code sample depicted in figure illustrates how mutex locks  available in the pthread api can be used to protect a critical section  pthreads uses the pthread mutex t data type for mutex locks  a mutex is created with the pthread mutex ini t mutex null  function with the first parameter being a pointer to the mutex  by passing null as a second parameter we initialize the mutex to  its default attributes the mutex is acquired and released with the  pthread mutex lock and pthread mutex unlock functions  if the mutex lock is unavailable when pthread mutex

creates a binary semaphore mutex with an initial  value of and illustrates its use in protecting a critical section  win  details concerning thread creation using the win api are available in  chapter please refer to that chapter for specific instructions  win mutex locks  mutex locks are a type of dispatcher object as described in section   the following illustrates how to create a mutex lock using the  createmutex function   include windows h  handle mutex  mutex createmutex null false null  the first parameter refers to a security attribute for the mutex lock by  setting this attribute to null we are disallowing any children of the  process creating this mutex lock to inherit the handle of the mutex  the second parameter indicates whether the creator of the mutex is the  initial owner of the mutex lock passing a value off alse indicates that  the thread creating the mutex is not the initial owner we shall soon see  how mutex locks are acquired the third parameter allows naming of    the mutex however because we provide a value of null we do not  name the mutex if successful createmutex returns a handle to the  mutex lock otherwise it returns null  in section  we identified dispatcher objects as being either  signaled or nonsignaled a signaled object is available for ownership  once a dispatcher object such as a mutex lock is acquired it moves to  the nonsignaled state when the object is released it returns to signaled  mutex locks are acquired by invoking the wai tforsingleobj ect  function passing the function the handle to the lock and a flag indicating  how long to wait the following code demonstrates how the mutex lock  created above can be acquired  waitforsingleobject mutex infinite  the parameter value infinite indicates that we will wait an infinite  amount of time for the lock to become available other values could  be used that would allow the calling thread to time out if the lock  did not become available within a specified time if the lock is in a  signaled state wai tforsingleobj ect returns immediately and the  lock becomes nonsignaled a lock is released moves to the signaled  state by invoking re leas emu t ex  such as  releasemutex mutex  win semaphores  semaphores in the win api are also dispatcher objects and thus use  the same signaling mechanism as mutex locks semaphores are created  as follows   include windows h  handle sem  sem createsemaphore null  null  the first and last parameters identify a security attribute and a name for  the semaphore similar to what was described for mutex locks the sec\\xad ond and third parameters indicate the initial value and maximum value  of the semaphore in this instance the initial value of the semaphore is  and its maximum value is if successful createsemaphore returns  a handle to the mutex lock otherwise it returns null  semaphores are acquired with the same wai tforsingleobj ect  function as mutex locks we acquire the semaphore sem created in this  example by using the statement  waitforsingleobject semaphore infinite  if the value of the semaphore is  the semaphore is in the signaled  state and thus is acquired by the calling thread otherwise the calling  thread blocks indefinitely as we are specifying infinite until the  semaphore becomes signaled   chapter  the equivalent of the signal operation on win semaphores is the  releasesemaphore function this function is passed three parame\\xad ters  a the handle of the semaphore  b the amount by which to increase the value of the semaphore  c a pointer to the previous value of the semaphore  we can increase sem by using the following statement  releasesemaphore sem  ll  both releasesemaphore and releasemutex return nonzero if  successful and zero otherwise  the mutual exclusion problem was first discussed in a classic paper by dijkstra   a dekker s algorithm exercise the first correct software solution  to the two process mutual exclusion problem was developed by

et al  discusses transactional  memory    ch er  in a multiprogramming environment several processes may compete for a  finite number of resources a process requests resources if the resources are  not available at that time the process enters a waiting state sometimes a  waiting process is never again able to change state because the resources it  has requested are held by other waiting processes this situation is called  a deadlock we discussed this issue briefly in chapter in cmmection with  semaphores  perhaps the best illustration of a deadlock can be drawn from a law passed  by the kansas legislature early in the th century it said in part when two  trains approach each other at a crossing both shall come to a full stop and  neither shall start up again until the other has gone  in this chapter we describe methods that an operating system can use  to prevent or deal with deadlocks although some applications can identify  programs that may deadlock operating systems typically do not provide  deadlock prevention facilities and it remains the responsibility of program\\xad mers to ensure that they design deadlock free programs deadlock problems  can only become more common given current trends including larger num\\xad bers of processes multithreaded programs many more resources withirt a  system and an emphasis on long lived file and database servers rather than  batch systems  to develop a description of deadlocks which prevent sets of concurrent  processes from completing their tasks  to present a number of different methods for preventing or avoiding  deadlocks in a computer system  a system consists of a finite number of resources to be distributed among  a number of competing processes the resources are partitioned into several     chapter  types each consisting of some number of identical instances memory space  cpu cycles files and i devices such as printers and dvd drives are examples  of resource types if a system has two cpus then the resource type cpu has  two instances similarly the resource type printer may have five instances  if a process requests an instance of a resource type the allocation of any  instance of the type will satisfy the request if it will not then the instances are  not identical and the resource type classes have not been defined properly for  example a system may have two printers these two printers may be defined to  be in the same resource class if no one cares which printer prints which output  however if one printer is on the ninth floor and the other is in the basement  then people on the ninth floor may not see both printers as equivalent and  separate resource classes may need to be defined for each printer  a process must request a resource before using it and must release the  resource after using it a process may request as many resources as it requires  to carry out its designated task obviously the number of resources requested  may not exceed the total number of resources available in the system in other  words a process cannot request three printers if the system has only two  under the normal mode of operation a process may utilize a resource in  only the following sequence  request the process requests the resource if the request cannot be  granted immediately for example if the resource is being used by another  process then the requesting process must wait until it can acquire the  resource  use the process can operate on the resource for example if the resource  is a printer the process can print on the printer  release the process releases the resource  the request and release of resources are system calls as explained in  chapter examples are the request and release device open and  close file and allocate and free memory system calls request and  release of resources that are not managed by the operating system can be  accomplished through the wait and signal operations on semaphores  or through acquisition and release of a mutex lock for each use of a kernel\\xad managed resource by a process or thread the operating system checks to  make sure that the process has requested and has been allocated the resource  a system table records whether each resource is free or allocated for each  resource that is allocated the table also records the process to which it is  allocated if a process requests a resource that is currently allocated to another  process it can be added to a queue of processes waiting for this resource  a set of processes is in a deadlocked state when every process in the set is  waiting for an event that can be caused only by another process in the set the  events with which we are mainly concerned here are resource acquisition and  release the resources may be either physical resources for example printers  tape drives memory space and cpu cycles or logical resources for example  files semaphores and monitors however other types of events may result in  deadlocks for example the ipc facilities discussed in chapter  to illustrate a deadlocked state consider a system with three cd rw drives  suppose each of three processes holds one of these cd rw drives if each process     now requests another drive the three processes will be in a deadlocked state  each is waiting for the event cd rw is released which can be caused only  by one of the other waiting processes this example illustrates a deadlock  involving the same resource type  deadlocks may also involve different resource types for example consider  a system with one printer and one dvd drive suppose that process p is holding  the dvd and process pi is holding the printer if p requests the printer and p  requests the dvd drive a deadlock occurs  a programmer who is developing multithreaded applications must pay  particular attention to this problem multithreaded programs are good candi\\xad dates for deadlock because multiple threads can compete for shared resources  in a deadlock processes never finish executing and system resources are tied  up preventing other jobs from starting before we discuss the various methods  for dealing with the deadlock problem we look more closely at features that  characterize deadlocks   necessary conditions  a deadlock situation can arise if the following four conditions hold simultane\\xad ously in a system  mutual exclusion at least one resource must be held in a nonsharable  mode that is only one process at a time can use the resource if another  deadlock with mutex locks  let s see how deadlock can occur in a multithreaded pthread program  using mutex locks the pthread mutex ini t function initializes  an unlocked mutex mutex locks are acquired and released using  pthread mutex lock and pthread mutex unlock  respec\\xad tively if a thread attempts to acquire a locked mutex the call to  pthread mutex lock blocks the thread until the owner of the mutex  lock invokes pthread mutex unlock   two mutex locks are created in the following code example  i create and initialize the mutex locks i  pthread mutex t first mutex  pthread mutex t second nmtex  pthread mutex ini t first mutex null  pthread mutex ini t second mutex null  next two threads thread one and thread two are created and both  these threads have access to both mutex locks thread one and thread two  run in the functions do work one and do work two  respectively as  shown in figure   chapter  deadlock with mutex locks continued  i thread one runs in this function i  void do work one void param     pthread mutex lock first mutex  pthread mutex lock second mutex  i   do some work   i  pthread mutex unlock second mutex  pthread mutex unlock first mutex  pthread exit   i thread two runs in this function i  void do work two void param     pthread mutex lock second mutex  pthread mutex lock first mutex  i   do some work   i  pthread mutex unlock first mutex  pthread mutex unlock second mutex  pthread exi t   figure deadlock example  in this example thread one attempts to acquire the mutex locks in the  order first mutex  second mutex while thread two attempts to  acquire the mutex locks in the order second mutex  first mutex  deadlock is possible if thread one acquires first mutex while thread two  aacquites second mutex  note that even though deadlock is possible it will not occur if thread one  is able to acquire and release the mutex locks for first mutex and sec\\xad ond mutex before thread two attemptsto acquire the locks this example  illustrates a problem with handling deadlocks it is difficult to identify and  test for deadlocks that may occur only under certain circumstances  process requests that resource the requesting process must be delayed  until the resource has been released  hold and wait a process must be holding at least one resource and  waiting to acquire additional resources that are cmrently being held by  other processes    no preemption resources cannot be preempted that is a resource can  be released only voluntarily by the process holding it after that process  has completed its task  circular wait a set p pl  p of waiting processes must exist such  that po is waiting for a resource held by p p is waiting for a resource  held by p  pn is waiting for a resource held by p v and p is waiting  for a resource held by po  we emphasize that all four conditions must hold for a deadlock to  occur the circular wait condition implies the hold and wait condition so the  four conditions are not completely independent we shall see in section  however that it is useful to consider each condition separately   resource allocation graph  deadlocks can be described more precisely in terms of a directed graph called  a graph this graph consists of a set of vertices v  and a set of edges e the set of vertices vis partitioned into two different types  of nodes p  p p  pn the set consisting of all the active processes in the  system and r  r r  rml the set consisting of all resource types in the  system  a directed edge from process g to resource type rj is denoted by p  rj  it signifies that process p has requested an instance of resource type rj and  is currently waiting for that resource a directed edge from resource type rj  to process p is denoted by r p it signifies that an instance of resource  type r has been allocated to process p a directed edge p  rj is called a  edge a directed edge r p is called an  pictorially we represent each process p as a circle and each resource type  rj as a rectangle since resource type ri may have more than one instance we  represent each such instance as a dot within the rectangle note that a request  edge points to only the rectangle r whereas an assignment edge must also  designate one of the dots in the rectangle  when process p requests an instance of resource type ri a request edge  is inserted in the resource allocation graph when this request can be fulfilled  the request edge is instantaneously transformed to an assignment edge when  the process no longer needs access to the resource it releases the resource as a  result the assignment edge is deleted  the resource allocation graph shown in figure depicts the following  situation  the sets p k and e  o p  p p p  or r r r    e  pl rlf p rf rl pf r pf r pl r p  resource instances  o one instance of resource type r  o two instances of resource type r   chapter  figure resource allocation graph  o one instance of resource type r  o three instances of resource type  process states  o process p is holding an instance of resource type r and is waiting for  an instance of resource type r  o process p is holding an instance of r and an instance of r and is  waiting for an instance of r  o process p is holding an instance of r  given the definition of a resource allocation graph it can be shown that if  the graph contains no cycles then no process in the system is deadlocked if  the graph does contain a cycle then a deadlock may exist  if each resource type has exactly one instance then a cycle implies that a  deadlock has occurred if the cycle involves only a set of resource types each  of which has only a single instance then a deadlock has occurred each process  involved in the cycle is deadlocked in this case a cycle in the graph is both a  necessary and a sufficient condition for the existence of deadlock  if each resource type has several instances then a cycle does not necessarily  imply that a deadlock has occurred in this case a cycle in the graph is a  necessary but not a sufficient condition for the existence of deadlock  to illustrate this concept we return to the resource allocation graph  depicted in figure suppose that process p requests an instance of resource  type r since no resource instance is currently available a request edge p   r is added to the graph figure  at this point two minimal cycles exist in  the system  p  r  p  r  p  r  p  p  r  p  r  p   deadlock characterization  figure resource allocation graph with a deadlock  processes p pz and p are deadlocked process pz is waiting for the resource  r which is held by process p process p is waiting for either process p or  process pz to release resource r in addition process p is waiting for process  pz to release resource r  now consider the resource allocation graph in figure in this example  we also have a cycle  however there is no deadlock observe that process p may release its instance  of resource type r that resource can then be allocated to p breaking the cycle  in summary if a resource allocation graph does not have a cycle then the  system is not in a deadlocked state if there is a cycle then the system may or  may not be in a deadlocked state this observation is important when we deal  with the deadlock problem  figure resource allocation graph with a cycle but no deadlock   chapter    generally speaking we can deal with the deadlock problem in one of three  ways  we can use a protocol to prevent or avoid deadlocks ensuring that the  system will never enter a deadlocked state  we can allow the system to enter a deadlocked state detect it and recover  we can ignore the problem altogether and pretend that deadlocks never  occur in the system  the third solution is the one used by most operating systems including unix  and windows it is then up to the application developer to write programs that  handle deadlocks  next we elaborate briefly on each of the three methods for handling  deadlocks then in sections through we present detailed algorithms  before proceeding we should mention that some researchers have argued that  none of the basic approaches alone is appropriate for the entire spectrum of  resource allocation problems in operating systems the basic approaches can  be combined however allowing us to select an optimal approach for each class  of resources in a system  to ensure that deadlocks never occur the  prevention or a deadlock avoidance scheme provides  a set of methods for ensuring that at least one of the necessary conditions   section  cannot hold these methods prevent deadlocks by constraining  how requests for resources can be made we discuss these methods in  section  requires that the operating system be given in  advance additional information concerning which resources a process will  request and use during its lifetime with this additional knowledge it can  decide for each request whether or not the process should wait to decide  whether the current request can be satisfied or must be delayed the system  must consider the resources currently available the resources currently allo\\xad cated to each process and the future requests and releases of each process we  discuss these schemes in section  if a system does not employ either a deadlock prevention or a deadlock\\xad avoidance algorithm then a deadlock situation may arise in this environment  the system can provide an algorithm that examines the state of the system to  determine whether a deadlock has occurred and an algorithm to recover from  the deadlock if a deadlock has indeed occurred we discuss these issues in  section and section  in the absence of algorithms to detect and recover from deadlocks we may  arrive at a situation in which the system is in a deadlock state yet has no way  of recognizing what has happened in this case the undetected deadlock will  result in deterioration of the system s performance because resources are being  held by processes that cannot run and because more and more processes as  they make requests for resources will enter a deadlocked state eventually the  system will stop functioning and will need to be restarted manually     although this method may not seem to be a viable approach to the deadlock  problem it is nevertheless used in most operating systems as mentioned  earlier in many systems deadlocks occur infrequently say once per year  thus this method is cheaper than the prevention avoidance or detection and  recovery methods which must be used constantly also in some circumstances  a system is in a frozen state but not in a deadlocked state we see this situation  for example with a real time process running at the highest priority or any  process running on a nonpreemptive scheduler and never returning control  to the operating system the system must have manual recovery methods for  such conditions and may simply use those techniques for deadlock recovery  as we noted in section  for a deadlock to occur each of the four necessary  conditions must hold by ensuring that at least one of these conditions cannot  hold we can prevent the occurrence of a deadlock we elaborate on this  approach by examining each of the four necessary conditions separately   mutual exclusion  the mutual exclusion condition must hold for nonsharable resources for  example a printer cannot be simultaneously shared by several processes  sharable resources in contrast do not require mutually exclusive access and  thus cannot be involved in a deadlock read only files are a good example of  a sharable resource if several processes attempt to open a read only file at the  same time they can be granted simultaneous access to the file a process never  needs to wait for a sharable resource in general however we cannot prevent  deadlocks by denying the mutual exclusion condition because some resources  are intrinsically nonsharable   hold and wait  to ensure that the hold and wait condition never occurs in the system we must  guarantee that whenever a process requests a resource it does not hold any  other resources one protocol that can be used requires each process to request  and be allocated all its resources before it begins execution we can implement  this provision by requiring that system calls requesting resources for a process  precede all other system calls  an alternative protocol allows a process to request resources only when it  has none a process may request some resources and use them before it can  request any additional resources however it must release all the resources that  it is currently allocated  to illustrate the difference between these two protocols we consider a  process that copies data from a dvd drive to a file on disk sorts the file and  then prints the results to a printer if all resources must be requested at the  beginning of the process then the process must initially request the dvd drive  disk file and printer it will hold the printer for its entire execution even though  it needs the printer only at the end  the second method allows the process to request initially only the dvd  drive and disk file it copies from the dvd drive to the disk and then releases   chapter  both the dvd drive and the disk file the process must then again request the  disk file and the printer after copying the disk file to the printer it releases  these two resources and terminates  both these protocols have two main disadvantages first resource utiliza\\xad tion may be low since resources may be allocated but unused for a long period  in the example given for instance we can release the dvd drive and disk file  and then again request the disk file and printer only if we can be sure that our  data will remain on the disk file otherwise we must request all resources at  the beginning for both protocols  second starvation is possible a process that needs several popular  resources may have to wait indefinitely because at least one of the resources  that it needs is always allocated to some other process   no preemption  the third necessary condition for deadlocks is that there be no preemption  of resources that have already been allocated to ensure that this condition  does not hold we can use the following protocol if a process is holding  some resources and requests another resource that cannot be immediately  allocated to it that is the process must wait then all resources the process is  currently holding are preempted in other words these resources are implicitly  released the preempted resources are added to the list of resources for which  the process is waiting the process will be restarted only when it can regain its  old resources as well as the new ones that it is requesting  alternatively if a process requests some resources we first check whether  they are available if they are we allocate them if they are not we check  whether they are allocated to some other process that is waiting for additional  resources if so we preempt the desired resources from the waiting process and  allocate them to the requesting process if the resources are neither available  nor held by a waiting process the requesting process must wait while it is  waiting some of its resources may be preempted but only if another process  requests them a process can be restarted only when it is allocated the new  resources it is requesting and recovers any resources that were preempted  while it was waiting  this protocol is often applied to resources whose state can be easily saved  and restored later such as cpu registers and memory space it cannot generally  be applied to such resources as printers and tape drives   circular wait  the fourth and final condition for deadlocks is the circular wait condition one  way to ensure that this condition never holds is to impose a total ordering of  all resource types and to require that each process requests resources in an  increasing order of enumeration  to illustrate we let r  r r  rm be the set of resource types we  assign to each resource type a unique integer number which allows us to  compare two resources and to determine whether one precedes another in our  ordering formally we define a one to one hmction f r  n where n is the  set of natural numbers for example if the set of resource types r includes  tape drives disk drives and printers then the function f might be defined as  follows    f tape drive   f disk drive   f printer   we can now consider the following protocol to prevent deadlocks each  process can request resources only in an increasing order of enumeration that  is a process can initially request any number of instances of a resource type   say r after that the process can request instances of resource type rj if  and only if f rj f r for example using the function defined previously  a process that wants to use the tape drive and printer at the same time must  first request the tape drive and then request the printer alternatively we can  require that a process requesting an instance of resource type rj must have  released any resources r such that f ri  f rj it must also be noted that if  several iilstances of the same resource type are needed a single request for all  of them must be issued  if these two protocols are used then the circular wait condition cannot  hold we can demonstrate this fact by assuming that a circular wait exists   proof by contradiction let the set of processes involved in the circular wait be   p p  p where pi is waiting for a resource r which is held by process  pi l· modulo arithmetic is used on the indexes so that p is waiting for  a resource r held by p then since process pi l is holding resource ri  while requesting resource ri l we must have f ri f r h for all i but  this condition means that f ro f r   f r f ro by transitivity  f ro f ro which is impossible therefore there can be no circular wait  we can accomplish this scheme in an application program by developing  an ordering among all synchronization objects in the system all requests for  synchronization objects must be made in increasing order for example if the  lock ordering in the pthread program shown in figure was  f first mutex   f second mutex   then thread two could not request the locks out of order  keep in mind that developing an ordering or hierarchy does not in itself  prevent deadlock it is up to application developers to write programs that  follow the ordering also note that the function f should be defined according  to the normal order of usage of the resources in a system for example because  the tape drive is usually needed before the printer it would be reasonable to  define f tape drive f printer  although ensuring that resources are acquired in the proper order is the  responsibility of application developers certain software can be used to verify  that locks are acquired in the proper order and to give appropriate warnings  when locks are acquired out of order and deadlock is possible one lock order  verifier which works on bsd versions of unix such as freebsd is known as  witness witness uses mutual exclusion locks to protect critical sections as  described in chapter it works by dynamically maintaining the relationship  of lock orders in a system let s use the program shown in figure as an  example assume that thread one is the first to acquire the locks and does so in  the order first mutex  second mutex wihess records the relationship  that first mutex must be acquired before second mutex if thread two later   chapter   acquires the locks out of order witness generates a warning message on the  system console  it is also important to note that imposing a lock ordering does not guarantee  deadlock prevention if locks can be acquired dynamically for example assume  we have a function that transfers funds between two accounts to prevent a  race condition each account has an associated semaphore that is obtained from  a get lock function such as the following  void transaction account from account to double amount     semaphore lock lock  lock getlock from  lock getlock to  wait lock  wait lock  withdraw from amount  deposit to amount  signal lock  signal lock  deadlock is possible if two threads simultaneously invoke the trans action  function transposing different accounts that is one thread might invoke  transaction checkingaccount savingsaccount   and another might invoke  transaction savingsaccount checkingaccount   we leave it as an exercise for students to fix this situation  deadlock prevention algorithms as discussed in section prevent deadlocks  by restraining how requests can be made the restraints ensure that at least  one of the necessary conditions for deadlock cannot occur and hence that  deadlocks cannot hold possible side effects of preventing deadlocks by this  method however are low device utilization and reduced system throughput  an alternative method for avoiding deadlocks is to require additional  information about how resources are to be requested for example in a system  with one tape drive and one printer the system might need to know that  process p will request first the tape drive and then the printer before releasing  both resources whereas process q will request first the printer and then the  tape drive with this knowledge of the complete sequence of requests and  releases for each process the system can decide for each request whether or  not the process should wait in order to avoid a possible future deadlock each  request requires that in making this decision the system consider the resources   deadlock avoidance  currently available the resources currently allocated to each process and the  future requests and releases of each process  the various algorithms that use this approach differ in the amount and type  of information required the simplest and most useful model requires that each  process declare the maximum number of resources of each type that it may need  given this a priori information it is possible to construct an algorithm that  ensures that the system will never enter a deadlocked state such an algorithm  defines the deadlock avoidance approach a deadlock avoidance algorithm  dynamically examines the resource allocation state to ensure that a circular\\xad wait condition can never exist the resource allocation state is defined by the  number of available and allocated resources and the maximum demands of  the processes in the following sections we explore two deadlock avoidance  algorithms   safe state  a state is safe if the system can allocate resources to each process up to its  maximum in some order and still avoid a deadlock more formally a system  is in a safe state only if there exists a safe sequence a sequence of processes   p p  pn is a safe sequence for the current allocation state if for each  pi the resource requests that pi can still make can be satisfied by the currently  available resources plus the resources held by all pj with j i in this situation  if the resources that pi needs are not immediately available then pi can wait  until all pj have finished when they have finished pi can obtain all of its  needed resources complete its designated task return its allocated resources  and terminate when pi terminates pi l can obtain its needed resources and  so on if no such sequence exists then the system state is said to be unsafe  a safe state is not a deadlocked state conversely a deadlocked state is  an unsafe state not all unsafe states are deadlocks however figure   an unsafe state may lead to a deadlock as long as the state is safe the  operating system can avoid unsafe and deadlocked states in an unsafe state  the operating system cannot prevent processes from requesting resources in  such a way that a deadlock occurs the behavior of the processes controls  unsafe states  figure safe unsafe and deadlocked state spaces   chapter deadlocks  to illustrate we consider a system with twelve magnetic tape drives and  three processes po p and p process po requires ten tape drives process p  may need as many as four tape drives and process p may need up to nine tape  drives suppose that at time to process po is holding five tape drives process  p is holding two tape drives and process p is holding two tape drives thus  there are three free tape drives  maximum needs current needs            at time t the system is in a safe state the sequence p p p satisfies  the safety condition process p can immediately be allocated all its tape drives  and then return them the system will then have five available tape drives  then process po can get all its tape drives and return them the system will then  have ten available tape drives and finally process p can get all its tape drives  and return them the system will then have all twelve tape drives available  a system can go from a safe state to an unsafe state suppose that at time  t process p requests and is allocated one more tape drive the system is no  longer in a safe state at this point only process p can be allocated all its tape  drives when it returns them the system will have only four available tape  drives since process po is allocated five tape drives but has a maximum of ten  it may request five more tape drives if it does so it will have to wait because  they are unavailable similarly process p may request six additional tape  drives and have to wait resulting in a deadlock our mistake was in granting  the request from process p for one more tape drive if we had made p wait  until either of the other processes had finished and released its resources then  we could have avoided the deadlock  given the concept of a safe state we can define avoidance algorithms that  ensure that the system will never deadlock the idea is simply to ensure that the  system will always remain in a safe state initially the system is in a safe state  whenever a process requests a resource that is currently available the system  must decide whether the resource can be allocated immediately or whether  the process must wait the request is granted only if the allocation leaves the  system in a safe state  in this scheme if a process requests a resource that is currently available  it may still have to wait thus resource utilization may be lower than it would  otherwise be   resource allocation graph algorithm  if we have a resource allocation system with only one instance of each resource  type we can use a variant of the resource allocation graph defined in section   for deadlock avoidance in addition to the request and assignment edges  already described we introduce a new type of edge called a claim edge  a claim edge pi rj indicates that process pi may request resource rj at  some time in the future this edge resembles a request edge in direction but is  represented in the graph by a dashed line when process pi requests resource    figure resource allocation graph for deadlock avoidance  r the claim edge p  r is converted to a request edge similarly when a  resource r is released by p the assignment edge rj p is reconverted to a  claim edge p  rj  we note that the resources must be claimed a priori in the system that is  before process p starts executing all its claim edges must already appear in  the resource allocation graph we can relax this condition by allowing a claim  edge p  r to be added to the graph only if all the edges associated with  process p are claim edges  now suppose that process p requests resource rj the request can be  granted only if converting the request edge p  rj to an assignment edge  r p does not result in the formation of a cycle in the resource allocation  graph we check for safety by using a cycle detection algorithm an algorithm  for detecting a cycle in this graph requires an order of n operations where n  is the number of processes in the system  if no cycle exists then the allocation of the resource will leave the system  in a safe state if a cycle is found then the allocation will put the system in  an unsafe state in that case process p will have to wait for its requests to be  satisfied  to illustrate this algorithm we consider the resource allocation graph of  figure suppose that p requests r although r is currently free we  cannot allocate it to p since this action will create a cycle in the graph figure   a cycle as mentioned indicates that the system is in an unsafe state if p  requests r and p requests r then a deadlock will occur  figure an unsafe state in a resource allocation graph   chapter   banker s algorithm  the resource allocation graph algorithm is not applicable to a resource\\xad allocation system with multiple instances of each resource type the deadlock\\xad avoidance algorithm that we describe next is applicable to such a system but  is less efficient than the resource allocation graph scheme this algorithm is  commonly known as the banker s algorithm the name was chosen because the  algorithm could be used in a banking system to ensure that the bank never  allocated its available cash in such a way that it could no longer satisfy the  needs of all its customers  when a new process enters the system it must declare the maximum  number of instances of each resource type that it may need this nun ber may  not exceed the total number of resources in the system when a user requests  a set of resources the system must determine whether the allocation of these  resources will leave the system in a safe state if it will the resources are  allocated otherwise the process must wait until some other process releases  enough resources  several data structures must be maintained to implement the banker s  algorithm these data structures encode the state of the resource allocation  system we need the following data structures where n is the number of  processes in the system and m is the number of resource types  available a vector of length m indicates the number of available resources  of each type if available j equals k then k instances of resource type ri  are available  max an n x m matrix defines the maximum demand of each process  if max i j equals k then process p may request at most k instances of  resource type ri  allocation an x m matrix defines the number of resources of each type  currently allocated to each process if allocation i j equals lc then process  p is currently allocated lc instances of resource type rj  need an n x m matrix indicates the remaining resource need of each  process if need i j equals k then process p may need k more instances of  resource type ri to complete its task note that need i j equals max i j   allocation i j  these data structures vary over time in both size and value  to simplify the presentation of the banker s algorithm we next establish  some notation let x andy be vectors of length we say that x y if and  only if x i  y i for all i    n for example if x   and y    then y x in addition y x if y x andy x  we can treat each row in the matrices allocation and need as vectors  and refer to them as allocation and need the vector allocation specifies  the resources currently allocated to process p the vector need specifies the  additional resources that process p may still request to complete its task   safety algorithm  we can now present the algorithm for finding out whether or not a systern is  in a safe state this algorithm can be described as follows    let work and finish be vectors of length m and n respectively initialize  work available and finish i false for i    n  find an index i such that both  a finish i false  b need  work  if no such i exists go to step  work work allocation  finish i true  go to step  if finish i true for all i then the system is in a safe state  this algorithm may require an order of m x n operations to determine whether  a state is safe   resource request algorithm  next we describe the algorithm for determining whether requests can be safely  granted  let request be the request vector for process p if request j  k then  process p wants k instances of resource type rj when a request for resources  is made by process p the following actions are taken  if request  need go to step otherwise raise an error condition since  the process has exceeded its maximum claim  if request  available go to step otherwise p must wait since the  resources are not available  have the system pretend to have allocated the requested resources to  process p by modifyil g the state as follows  available available request  allocation allocation request  need need request  if the resulting resource allocation state is safe the transaction is com\\xad pleted and process p is allocated its resources however if the new state  is unsafe then p must wait for request and the old resource allocation  state is restored   an illustrative example  to illustrate the use of the banker s algorithm consider a system with five  processes po through p and three resource types a b and c resource type a  has ten instances resource type b has five instances and resource type c has  seven instances suppose that at time t the following snapshot of the system  has been taken   chapter  allocation max available  abc abc abc  po  pl  p  p  p  the content of the matrix need is defined to be max allocation and is as  follows  need  abc  po  pl  p  p  p  we claim that the system is currently in a safe state indeed the sequence   plt p p p po satisfies the safety criteria suppose now that process  p requests one additional instance of resource type a and two instances of  resource type c so request   to decide whether this request can be  immediately granted we first check that request s available that is that    s  which is true we then pretend that this request has been  fulfilled and we arrive at the following new state  allocation need available  abc abc abc  po  pl  p  p  p  we must determine whether this new system state is safe to do so we  execute our safety algorithm and find that the sequence p p p po p  satisfies the safety requirement hence we can immediately grant the request  of process p  you should be able to see however that when the system is in this state a  request for  by p cannot be granted since the resources are not available  furthermore a request for  by po cannot be granted even though the  resources are available since the resulting state is unsafe  we leave it as a programming exercise for students to implement the  banker s algorithm     if a system does not employ either a deadlock prevention or a deadlock\\xad avoidance algorithm then a deadlock situation may occur in this environment  the system may provide  an algorithm that examines the state of the system to determine whether  a deadlock has occurred  an algorithm to recover from the deadlock  in the following discussion we elaborate on these two requirements as they  pertain to systems with only a single instance of each resource type as well as to  systems with several instances of each resource type at this point however we  note that a detection and recovery scheme requires overhead that includes not  only the run time costs of maintaining the necessary information and executing  the detection algorithm but also the potential losses inherent in recovering from  a deadlock   single instance of each resource type  if all resources have only a single instance then we can define a deadlock\\xad detection algorithm that uses a variant of the resource allocation graph called  a wait for graph we obtain this graph from the resource allocation graph by  removing the resource nodes and collapsing the appropriate edges  more precisely an edge from pi to pi in a wait for graph implies that  process pz is waiting for process p to release a resource that p needs an edge  pz  pi exists iil a wait for graph if and only if the corresponding resource\\xad allocation graph contains two edges pz  rq and rq  pi for some resource  rq for example in figure we present a resource allocation graph and the  corresponding wait for graph  as before a deadlock exists in the system if and only if the wait for graph  contains a cycle to detect deadlocks the system needs to maintain the wait for  graph and periodically invoke an algorithm that searches for a cycle in the graph  an algorithm to detect a cycle in a graph requires an order of n operations  where n is the number of vertices in the graph   several instances of a resource type  the wait for graph scheme is not applicable to a resource allocation system  with multiple instances of each resource type we turn now to a deadlock\\xad detection algorithm that is applicable to such a system the algorithm employs  several time varying data structures that are similar to those used in the  banker s algorithm section   available a vector of length nz indicates the number of available resources  of each type  allocation ann x nz matrix defines the number of resources of each type  currently allocated to each process   chapter   a b  figure a resource allocation graph b corresponding wait for graph  request an n x m matrix indicates the current request of each process  if request i j equals k then process p is requesting k more instances of  resource type rj  the  relation between two vectors is defined as in section  to simplify  notation we again treat the rows in the matrices allocation and request as  vectors we refer to them as allocation and request the detection algorithm  described here simply investigates every possible allocation sequence for the  processes that remain to be completed compare this algorithm with the  banker s algorithm of section   let work and finish be vectors of length m and n respectively initialize  work available fori   n if allocation  then finish i false  otherwise finish i tme   find an index i such that both  a finish i false  b request  work  if no such i exists go to step  work work allocation  finish i true  go to step   if finish i false for some i  i n then the system is in a deadlocked  state moreover if finish i false then process p is deadlocked  this algorithm requires an order o£ m x n operations to detect whether the  system is in a deadlocked state    you may wonder why we reclaim the resources of process p in step  as soon as we determine that request s work in step b we know that p  is currently not involved in a deadlock since request s work thus we take  an optimistic attitude and assume that p will require no more resources to  complete its task it will thus soon return all currently allocated resources to  the system if our assumption is incorrect a deadlock may occur later that  deadlock will be detected the next tince the deadlock detection algorithm is  invoked  to illustrate this algorithm we consider a system with five processes po  through p and three resource types a b and c resource type a has seven  instances resource type b has two instances and resource type c has six  instances suppose that at time t we have the following resource allocation  state  allocation request available  abc abc abc  po   pl  p  p  p  we claim that the system is not in a deadlocked state indeed if we execute  our algorithm we will find that the sequence po p p plt p results in  finish i  true for all i  suppose now that process p makes one additional request for an instance  of type c the request matrix is modified as follows  request  abc  po  pl  p  p  p  we claim that the system is now deadlocked although we can reclaim the  resources held by process po the number of available resources is not sufficient  to fulfill the requests of the other processes thus a deadlock exists consisting  of processes p p p and p   detection algorithm usage  when should we invoke the detection algorithm the answer depends on two  factors   how often is a deadlock likely to occur  how many processes will be affected by deadlock when it happens   chapter   if deadlocks occur frequently then the detection algorithm should be invoked  frequently resources allocated to deadlocked processes will be idle until the  deadlock can be broken in addition the number of processes involved in the  deadlock cycle may grow  deadlocks occur only when some process makes a request that cannot be  granted immediately this request may be the final request that completes a  chain of waiting processes in the extreme then we can invoke the deadlock\\xad detection algorithm every time a request for allocation cannot be granted  immediately in this case we can identify not only the deadlocked set of  processes but also the specific process that caused the deadlock in reality  each of the deadlocked processes is a link in the cycle in the resource graph so  all of them jointly caused the deadlock if there are many different resource  types one request may create many cycles in the resource graph each cycle  completed by the most recent request and caused by the one identifiable  process  of course invoking the deadlock detection algorithm for every resource  request will incur considerable overhead in computation time a less expensive  alternative is simply to invoke the algorithm at defined intervals for example  once per hour or whenever cpu utilization drops below percent a deadlock  eventually cripples system throughput and causes cpu utilization to drop if  the detection algorithm is invoked at arbitrary points in time the resource  graph may contain many cycles in this case we generally cannot tell which of  the many deadlocked processes caused the deadlock  when a detection algorithm determines that a deadlock exists several alter\\xad natives are available one possibility is to inform the operator that a deadlock  has occurred and to let the operator deal with the deadlock manually another  possibility is to let the system recover from the deadlock automatically there  are two options for breaking a deadlock one is simply to abort one or more  processes to break the circular wait the other is to preempt some resources  from one or more of the deadlocked processes   process termination  to eliminate deadlocks by aborting a process we use one of two methods in  both methods the system reclaims all resources allocated to the terminated  processes  abort all deadlocked processes this method clearly will break the  deadlock cycle but at great expense the deadlocked processes may have  computed for a long time and the results of these partial computations  must be discarded and probably will have to be recomputed later  abort one process at a time until the deadlock cycle is eliminated this  method incurs considerable overhead since after each process is aborted a  deadlock detection algorithnc rnust be invoked to determine whether any  processes are still deadlocked    aborting a process may not be easy if the process was in the midst of  updating a file terminating it will leave that file in an incorrect state similarly  if the process was in the midst of printing data on a printer the system must  reset the printer to a correct state before printing the next job  if the partial termination method is used then we must determine which  deadlocked process or processes should be terminated this determination is  a policy decision similar to cpu scheduling decisions the question is basically  an economic one we should abort those processes whose termination will incur  the minimum cost unfortunately the term minimum cost is not a precise one  many factors may affect which process is chosen including   what the priority of the process is   how long the process has computed and how much longer the process  will compute before completing its designated task  how many and what types of resources the process has used for example  whether the resources are simple to preempt  how many more resources the process needs in order to complete   how many processes will need to be terminated  whether the process is interactive or batch   resource preemption  to eliminate deadlocks using resource preemption we successively preempt  some resources from processes and give these resources to other processes m til  the deadlock cycle is broken  if preemption is required to deal with deadlocks then three issues need to  be addressed  selecting a victim which resources and which processes are to be  preempted as in process termil ation we must determine the order of  preemption to minimize cost cost factors may include such parameters  as the number of resources a deadlocked process is holding and the  amount of time the process has thus far consumed during its execution  rollback if we preempt a resource from a process what should be done  with that process clearly it cannot contil ue with its normal execution it  is missing some needed resource we must roll back the process to some  safe state and restart it from that state  since in general it is difficult to determine what a safe state is the  simplest solution is a total rollback abort the process and then restart  it although it is more effective to roll back the process only as far as  necessary to break the deadlock this method requires the system to keep  more information about the state of all running processes  starvation how do we ensure that starvation will not occur that is  how can we guarantee that resources will not always be preempted from  the same process   chapter   in a system where victim selection is based primarily on cost factors  it may happen that the same process is always picked as a victim as  a result this process never completes its designated task a starvation  situation that must be dealt with in any practical system clearly we  must ensure that a process can be picked as a victim only a small finite  number of times the most common solution is to include the number of  rollbacks in the cost factor  a deadlocked state occurs when two or more processes are waiting indefinitely  for an event that can be caused only by one of the waiting processes there are  three principal methods for dealing with deadlocks  use some protocol to prevent or avoid deadlocks ensuring that the system  will never enter a deadlocked state  allow the system to enter a deadlocked state detect it and then recover  ignore the problem altogether and pretend that deadlocks never occur in  the system  the third solution is the one used by most operating systems including unix  and windows  a deadlock can occur only if four necessary conditions hold simultaneously  in the system mutual exclusion hold and wait no preemption and circular  wait to prevent deadlocks we can ensure that at least one of the necessary  conditions never holds  a method for avoiding deadlocks rather than preventing them requires  that the operating system have a priori information about how each process  will utilize system resources the banker s algorithm for example requires  a priori information about the maximunl number of each resource class that  each process may request using this information we can define a deadlock\\xad avoidance algorithm  if a system does not employ a protocol to ensure that deadlocks will never  occur then a detection and recovery scheme may be employed a deadlock\\xad detection algorithm must be invoked to detennine whether a deadlock  has occurred if a deadlock is detected the system must recover either by  terminating some of the deadlocked processes or by preempting resources  from some of the deadlocked processes  where preemption is used to deal with deadlocks three issues must be  addressed selecting a victim rollback and starvation in a system that selects  victims for rollback primarily on the basis of cost factors starvation may occur  and the selected process can never complete its designated task  researchers have argued that none of the basic approaches alone is appro\\xad priate for the entire spectrum of resource allocation problems in operating  systems the basic approaches can be combined however allowing us to select  an optimal approach for each class of resources in a system     a single lane bridge connects the two vermont villages of north  tunbridge and south tunbridge farmers in the two villages use this  bridge to deliver their produce to the neighboring town the bridge  can become deadlocked if a northbound and a southbound farmer get  on the bridge at the same time vermont farmers are stubborn and are  unable to back up using semaphores design an algorithm that prevents  deadlock initially do not be concerned about starvation the situation  in which northbound farmers prevent southbound farmers from using  the bridge or vice versa   modify your solution to exercise so that it is starvation free   consider a system consisting of four resources of the same type that are  shared by three processes each of which needs at most two resources  show that the system is deadlock free   consider the traffic deadlock depicted in figure  a show that the four necessary conditions for deadlock hold in this  example  b state a simple rule for avoiding deadlocks in this system   in a real computer system neither the resources available nor the  demands of processes for resources are consistent over long periods   months resources break or are replaced new processes come and go  and new resources are bought and added to the system if deadlock is  controlled by the banker s algorithm which of the following changes  figure traffic deadlock for exercise   chapter  can be made safely without introducing the possibility of deadlock  and under what circumstances  a increase available new resources added  b decrease available resource permanently removed from system  c increase max for one process the process needs or wants rnore  resources than allowed  d decrease max for one process the process decides it does not need  that many resources  e increase the number of processes  f decrease the number of processes   we can obtain the banker s algorithm for a single resource type from  the general banker s algorithm simply by reducing the dimensionality  of the various arrays by show through an example that we cannot  implement the multiple resource type banker s scheme by applying the  sil gle resource type scheme to each resource type individually   consider the following resource allocation policy requests for and  releases of resources are allowed at any time if a request for resources  cannot be satisfied because the resources are not available then we check  any processes that are blocked waiting for resources if a blocked process  has the desired resources then these resources are taken away from it  and are given to the requestmg process the vector of resources for which  the blocked process is waiting is increased to include the resources that  were taken away  for example consider a system with three resource types and the  vector available initialized to  if process po asks for  it gets  them if p asks for  it gets them then if po asks for  it  is blocked resource not available if p now asks for  it gets the  available one  and one that was allocated to po since po is blocked  po s allocation vector goes down to  and its need vector goes up  to   a can deadlock occur if you answer yes give an example if you  answer no specify which necessary condition cannot occur  b can indefinite blocking occur explain your answer   a possible method for preventing deadlocks is to have a single higher\\xad order resource that must be requested before any other resource for  example if multiple threads attempt to access the synchronization  objects a··· e deadlock is possible such synchronization objects may  include mutexes semaphores condition variables and the like we can  prevent the deadlock by adding a sixth object f whenever a thread  wants to acquire the synchronization lock for any object it must  first acquire the lock for object f this solution is known as containment  the locks for objects a··· e are contained within the lock for object f  compare this scheme with the circular wait scheme of section      compare the circular wait scheme with the various deadlock avoidance  schemes like the banker

granted immediately   consider a system consisting of m resources of the same type being  shared by n processes a process can request or release only one resource  at a time show that the system is deadlock free if the following two  conditions hold  a the maximum need of each process is between one resource and  m resources  b the sum of all maximum needs is less than m n   consider a computer system that runs jobs per month and has no  deadlock prevention or deadlock avoidance scheme deadlocks occur  about twice per month and the operator must terminate and rerun about   jobs per deadlock each job is worth about in cpu time and the  jobs terminated tend to be about half done when they are aborted  a systems programmer has estimated that a deadlock avoidance  algorithm like the banker s algorithm could be installed in the system  with an increase in the average execution time per job of about percent  since the machine currently has percent idle time all jobs per  month could still be run although turnaround time would increase by  about percent on average  a what are the arguments for installing the deadlock avoidance  algorithm  b what are the arguments against installing the deadlock avoidance  algorithm   chapter   consider the deadlock situation that can occur in the dining\\xad philosophers problem when the philosophers obtain the chopsticks one  at a time discuss how the four necessary conditions for deadlock hold  in this setting discuss how deadlocks could be avoided by eliminating  any one of the four necessary conditions   what is the optimistic assumption made in the deadlock detection  algorithm how can this assumption be violated   consider the version of the dining philosophers problem in which the  chopsticks are placed at the center of the table and any two of them  can be used by a philosopher assume that requests for chopsticks are  made one at a time describe a simple rule for determining whether a  particular request can be satisfied without causing deadlock given the  current allocation of chopsticks to philosophers   is it possible to have a deadlock involving only a single process explain  your answer   consider again the setting in the preceding question assume now that  each philosopher requires three chopsticks to eat resource requests are  still issued one at a time describe some simple rules for determining  whether a particular request can be satisfied without causing deadlock  given the current allocation of chopsticks to philosophers   in section  we describe a situation in which we prevent deadlock  by ensuring that all locks are acquired in a certain order however  we also point out that deadlock is possible in this situation if two  threads simultaneously invoke the transaction function fix the  transaction function to prevent deadlocks   write a multithreaded program that implements the banker s algorithm  discussed in section  create n threads that request and release  resources from the bank the banker will grant the request only if it  leaves the system in a safe state you may write this program using  either pthreads or win threads it is important that shared data be safe  from concurrent access to ensure safe access to shared data you can  use mutex locks which are available in both the pthreads and win  apis the use of mutex locks in both of these libraries is described in the  project entitled producer consumer problem at the end of chapter  dijkstra a was one of the first and most influential contributors in the  deadlock area holt was the first person to formalize the notion of  deadlocks in terms of an allocation graph model similar to the one presented  in this chapter starvation was also covered by holt  hyman  provided the deadlock example from the kansas legislature a recent study of  deadlock handling is provided in levine     the various prevention algorithms were suggested by havender   who devised the resource ordering scheme for the ibm os systen l  the banker s algorithm for avoiding deadlocks was developed for a single  resource type by dijkstra a and was extended to multiple resource types  by habermam l  exercises and are from holt   the deadlock detection algorithm for multiple instances of a resource type  which is described in section  was presented by coffman et al   bach describes how many of the algorithms in the traditional unix  kernel handle deadlock solutions to deadlock problems in networks are  discussed in works such as culler et al  and rodeheffer and schroeder    the witness lock order verifier is presented in baldwin    part four  the main purpose of a computer system is to execute programs these  programs together with the data they access must be at least partially  in main memory during execution  to improve both the utilization of the cpu and the speed of its  response to users a general purpose computer must keep several pro\\xad cesses in memory many memory management schemes exist reflect\\xad ing various approaches and the effectiveness of each algorithm depends  on the situation selection of a memory management scheme for a sys\\xad tem depends on many factors especially on the hardware design of the  system most algorithms require hardware support    c  in chapter we showed how the cpu can be shared by a set of processes as  a result of cpu scheduling we can improve both the utilization of the cpu and  the speed of the computer s response to its users to realize this increase in  performance however we must keep several processes in memory that is we  must share memory  in this chapter we discuss various ways to manage memory the memory\\xad management algorithms vary from a primitive bare machine approach to  paging and segmentation strategies each approach has its own advantages  and disadvantages selection of a memory management method for a specific  system depends on many factors especially on the hardware design of the  system as we shall see many algorithms require hardware support although  recent designs have closely integrated the hardware and operating system  to provide a detailed description of various ways of organizing memory  hardware  to discuss various memory management techniques including paging  and segmentation  to provide a detailed description of the intel pentium which supports both  pure segmentation and segmentation with paging  as we saw in chapter memory is central to the operation of a modern  computer system memory consists of a large array of words or bytes each  with its own address the cpu fetches instructions from memory according  to the value of the program counter these instructions may cause additional  loading from and storing to specific memory addresses  a typical instruction execution cycle for example first fetches an instruc\\xad tion from memory the instruction is then decoded and may cause operands  to be fetched from memory after the instruction has been executed on the     chapter  operands results may be stored back in memory the mernory unit sees only a  stream of memory addresses it does not know how they are generated by the  instruction counter indexing indirection literal addresses and so on or what  they are for instructions or data accordingly we can ignore hozu a program  generates a memory address we are interested only in the sequence of memory  addresses generated by the running program  we begin our discussion by covering several issues that are pertinent to the  various techniques for managing memory this coverage includes an overview  of basic hardware issues the binding of symbolic memory addresses to actual  physical addresses and the distinction between logical and physical addresses  we conclude the section with a discussion of dynamically loading and linking  code and shared libraries   basic hardware  main memory and the registers built into the processor itself are the only  storage that the cpu can access directly there are machine instructions that take  memory addresses as arguments but none that take disk addresses therefore  any instructions in execution and any data being used by the instructions  must be in one of these direct access storage devices if the data are not in  memory they must be moved there before the cpu can operate on them  registers that are built into the cpu are generally accessible within one  cycle of the cpu clock most cpus can decode instructions and perform simple  operations on register contents at the rate of one or more operations per  clock tick the same cannot be said of main memory which is accessed via  a transaction on the memory bus completing a memory access may take  many cycles of the cpu clock in such cases the processor normally needs  to stall since it does not have the data required to complete the instruction  that it is executing this situation is intolerable because of the frequency of  memory accesses the remedy is to add fast memory between the cpu and    operating  system      process   i soa lj o i  process base   i go i i   limit process      figure a base and a limit register define a logical address space    main memory a memory buffer used to accommodate a speed differential  called a is described in section   not only are we concerned with the relative speed of accessing physical  memory but we also must ensure correct operation to protect the operating  system from access by user processes and in addition to protect user processes  from one another this protection must be provided by the hardware it can be  implemented in several ways as we shall see throughout the chapter in this  section we outline one possible implementation  we first need to make sure that each process has a separate memory space  to do this we need the ability to determine the range of legal addresses that  the process may access and to ensure that the process can access only these  legal addresses we can provide this protection by using two registers usually  a base and a limit as illustrated in figure the base holds the  smallest legal physical memory address the specifies the size of  the range for example if the base register holds and the limit register is   then the program can legally access all addresses from through   inclusive  protection of memory space is accomplished by having the cpu hardware  compare every address generated in user mode with the registers any attempt  by a program executing in user mode to access operating system memory or  other users memory results in a trap to the operating system which treats the  attempt as a fatal error figure  this scheme prevents a user program from   accidentally or deliberately modifying the code or data structures of either  the operating system or other users  the base and limit registers can be loaded only by the operating system  which uses a special privileged instruction since privileged instructions can  be executed only in kernel mode and since only the operating system executes  in kernel mode only the operating system can load the base and limit registers  this scheme allows the operating system to change the value of the registers  but prevents user programs from changing the registers contents  the operating system executing in kernel mode is given unrestricted  access to both operating system memory and users memory this provision  allows the operating system to load users programs into users memory to  yes  no  trap to operating system  monitor addressing error memory  figure hardware address protection with base and limit registers   chapter  dump out those programs in case of errors to access and modify parameters  of system calls and so on   address binding  usually a program resides on a disk as a binary executable file to be executed  the program must be brought into memory and placed within a process  depending on the memory management in use the process may be moved  between disk and memory during its execution the processes on the disk that  are waiting to be brought into memory for execution form the  the normal procedure is to select one of the processes in the input queue  and to load that process into memory as the process is executed it accesses  instructions and data from memory eventually the process terminates and its  memory space is declared available  most systems allow a user process to reside in any part of the physical  memory thus although the address space of the computer starts at  the first address of the user process need not be this approach affects  the addresses that the user program can use in most cases a user program  will go through several steps some of which may be optional before bein g  executed figure  addresses may be represented in different ways during  these steps addresses in the source program are generally symbolic such as  count a compiler will typically bind these symbolic addresses to relocatable  addresses such as bytes from the beginning of this module the lin kage  editor or loader will in turn bind the relocatable addresses to absolute addresses   such as each binding is a mapping from one address space to another  classically the binding of instructions and data to memory addresses can  be done at any step along the way  compile time if you know at compile time where the process will reside  in memory then can be generated for example if you krww  that a user process will reside starting at location r then the generated  compiler code will start at that location and extend up from there if at  some later time the starting location changes then it will be necessary  to recompile this code the ms dos com format programs are bound at  compile time  load time if it is not known at compile time where the process will reside  in memory then the compiler must generate in this case  final binding is delayed until load time if the starting address changes we  need only reload the user code to incorporate this changed value  execution time if the process can be moved during its execution from  one memory segment to another then binding must be delayed until run  time special hardware must be available for this scheme to work as will  be discussed in section  most general purpose operating systems se  this method  a major portion of this chapter is devoted to showing how these vari\\xad ous bindings can be implemented effectively in a computer system and to  discussing appropriate hardware support    compile  time  load  time   execution  time run  time  figure multistep processing of a user program   logical versus physical address space  an address generated by the cpu is commonly referred to as a  whereas an address seen by the memory unit that is the one loaded into  the of the memory is commonly referred to as a  the compile time and load time address binding methods generate iden\\xad tical logical and physical addresses however the execution time address  binding scheme results in differing logical and addresses in this case  we usually refer to the logical address as a we use logical address  and virtual address interchangeably in this text the set of all logical addresses  generated by a program is a logical the set of all physical  addresses corresponding to these logical addresses is a physical  thus in the execution time address binding scheme the logical and physical  address spaces differ  the run time mapping from virtual to physical addresses is done by a  hardware device called the we can choose  from many different methods to accomplish such mapping as we discuss in   chapter  figure dynamic relocation using a relocation register  sections through for the time being we illustrate this mapping with  a simple mmu scheme that is a generalization of the base register scheme  described in section  the base register is now called a  the value in the relocation register is added to every address generated by a user  process at the time the address is sent to memory see figure  for example  if the base is at then an attempt by the user to address location is  dynamically relocated to location an access to location is mapped  to location the ms dos operating system running on the intel x  family of processors used four relocation registers when loading and running  processes  the user program never sees the real physical addresses the program can  create a pointer to location store it in memory manipulate it and compare it  with other addresses all as the number only when it is used as a memory  address in an indirect load or store perhaps is it relocated relative to the base  register the user program deals with logical addresses the memory mapping  hardware converts logical addresses into physical addresses this form of  execution time binding was discussed in section  the final location of  a referenced memory address is not determined until the reference is made  we now have two different types of addresses logical addresses in the  range to max and physical addresses in the ranger tor max for a base  valuer the user generates only logical addresses and thinks that the process  runs in locations to max the user program generates only logical addresses  and thinks that the process runs in locations to max however these logical  addresses must be mapped to physical addresses before they are used  the concept of a logical address space that is bound to a separate physical  address space is central to proper memory management   dynamic loading  in our discussion so far it has been necessary for the entire program and all  data of a process to be in physical memory for the process to execute the size  of a process has thus been limited to the size of physical memory to obtain  better memory space utilization we can use dynamic with dynancic    loading a routine is not loaded until it is called all routines are kept on disk  in a relocatable load format the main program is loaded into memory and  is executed when a routine needs to call another routine the calling routine  first checks to see whether the other routine has been loaded if it has not the  relocatable linking loader is called to load the desired routine into menwry and  to update the program s address tables to reflect this change then control is  passed to the newly loaded routine  the advantage of dynamic loading is that an unused routine is never  loaded this method is particularly useful when large amounts of code are  needed to handle infrequently occurring cases such as error routines in this  case although the total program size may be large the portion that is used   and hence loaded may be much smaller  dynamic loading does not require special support from the operating  system it is the responsibility of the users to design their programs to take  advantage of such a method operating systems may help the programmer  however by providing library routines to implement dynamic loading   dynamic linking and shared libraries  figure also shows some operating systems  support only linking in system language libraries are treated  like any other object module and are combined by the loader into the binary  program image dynamic linking in contrast is similar to dynamic loading  here though linking rather than loading is postponed until execution time  this feature is usually used with system libraries such as language subroutine  libraries without this facility each program on a system must include a copy  of its language library or at least the routines referenced by the program in the  executable image this requirement wastes both disk space and main memory  with dynamic linking a stub is included in the image for each library\\xad routine reference the stub is a small piece of code that indicates how to locate  the appropriate memory resident library routine or how to load the library if  the routine is not already present when the stub is executed it checks to see  whether the needed routine is already in memory if it is not the program loads  the routine into memory either way the stub replaces itself with the address  of the routine and executes the routine thus the next time that particular  code segment is reached the library routine is executed directly incurring no  cost for dynamic linking under this scheme all processes that use a language  library execute only one copy of the library code  this feature can be extended to library updates such as bug fixes a library  may be replaced by a new version and all programs that reference the library  will automatically use the new version without dynamic linking all such  programs would need to be relinked to gain access to the new library so that  programs will not accidentally execute new incompatible versions of libraries  version information is included in both the program and the library more than  one version of a library may be loaded into memory and each program uses its  version information to decide which copy of the library to use versions with  minor changes retain the same version number whereas versions with major  changes increment the number thus only programs that are compiled with  the new library version are affected by any incompatible changes incorporated   chapter   in it other programs linked before the new library was installed will continue  using the older library this system is also known as h•   unlike dynamic loading dynamic linking generally requires help from the  operating system if the processes in memory are protected from one another  then the operating system is the only entity that can check to see whether the  needed routine is in another process s memory space or that can allow multiple  processes to access the same memory addresses we elaborate on this concept  when we discuss paging in section   a process must be in memory to be executed a process however can be  temporarily out of memory to a and then brought  into memory for continued execution for example assume a multipro\\xad gramming environment with a round robin cpu scheduling algorithm when  a quantum expires the memory manager will start to swap out the process that  just finished and to swap another process into the memory space that has been  freed figure  in the meantime the cpu scheduler will allocate a time slice  to some other process in memory when each process finishes its quantum it  will be swapped with another process ideally the memory manager can swap  processes fast enough that some processes will be in memory ready to execute  when the cpu scheduler wants to reschedule the cpu in addition the quantum  must be large enough to allow reasonable amounts of computing to be done  between swaps  a variant of this swapping policy is used for priority based scheduling  algorithms if a higher priority process arrives and wants service the memory  manager can swap out the lower priority process and then load and execute  the higher priority process when the higher priority process finishes the   swap out   swap in  backing store  main memory  figure swapping of two processes using a disk as a backing store    lower priority process can be swapped back in and continued this variant  of swapping is sometimes called roll  normally a process that is swapped out will be swapped back into the  same memory space it occupied previously this restriction is dictated by the  method of address binding if binding is done at assembly or load time then  the process cannot be easily moved to a different location if execution time  binding is being used however then a process can be swapped into a different  memory space because the physical addresses are computed during execution  time  swapping requires a backing store the backing store is commonly a fast  disk it must be large enough to accommodate copies of all memory images  for all users and it must provide direct access to these memory images the  system maintains a consisting of all processes whose memory  images are on the backing store or in memory and are ready to run whenever  the cpu scheduler decides to execute a process it calls the dispatcher the  dispatcher checks to see whether the next process in the queue is in memory  if it is not and if there is no free memory region the dispatcher swaps out a  process currently in memory and swaps in the desired process it then reloads  registers and transfers control to the selected process  the context switch time in such a swapping system is fairly high to get  an idea of the context switch time let us assume that the user process is  mb in size and the backing store is a standard hard disk with a transfer rate of  mb per second the actual transfer of the mb process to or from main  memory takes  mb mb per second seconds  assuming an average latency of milliseconds the swap time is  milliseconds since we must both swap out and swap in the total swap time is  about milliseconds  notice that the major part of the swap time is transfer time the total  transfer time is directly proportional to the amount of memory swapped if we  have a computer system with gb of main memory and a resident operating  system taking gb the maximum size of the user process is gb however  many user processes may be much smaller than this say mb a mb  process could be swapped out in seconds compared with the seconds  required for swapping gb clearly it would be useful to know exactly how  much memory a user process is using not simply how much it might be using  then we would need to swap only what is actually used reducing swap time  for this method to be effective the user must keep the system informed of  any changes in memory requirements thus a process with dynamic memory  requirements will need to issue system calls request memory and release  memory to inform the operating system of its changing memory needs  swapping is constrained by other factors as well if we want to swap  a process we must be sure that it is completely idle of particular concern  is any pending i a process may be waiting for an i operation when  we want to swap that process to free up memory however if the i is  asynchronously accessing the user memory for i buffers then the process  cannot be swapped assume that the i operation is queued because the  device is busy if we were to swap out process p and swap in process p the   chapter   i operation might then attempt to use memory that now belongs to process  p there are two main solutions to this problem never swap a process with  pending i or execute i operations only into operating system buffers  transfers between operating system buffers and process memory then occur  only when the process is swapped in  the assumption mentioned earlier that swapping requires few if any  head seeks needs further explanation we postpone discussing this issue until  chapter where secondary storage structure is covered generally swap  space is allocated as a chunk of disk separate from the file system so that its  use is as fast as possible  currently standard swapping is used in few systems it requires too  much swapping time and provides too little execution time to be a reasonable  memory management solution modified versions of swapping however are  found on many systems  a modification of swapping is used in many versions of unix swapping is  normally disabled but will start if many processes are running and are using a  threshold amount of memory swapping is again halted when the load on the  system is reduced memory management in unix is described fully in sections   and a  early pcs which lacked the sophistication to implement more advanced  memory management methods ran multiple large processes by using a  modified version of swapping a prime example is the microsoft windows   operating system which supports concurrent execution of processes in  memory if a new process is loaded and there is insufficient main memory  an old process is swapped to disk this operating system does not provide  full swapping however because the user rather than the scheduler decides  when it is time to preempt one process for another any swapped out process  remains swapped out and not executing until the user selects that process to  run subsequent versions of microsoft operating systems take advantage of the  advanced mmu features now found in pcs we explore such features in section   and in chapter where we cover virtual memory  the main memory must accommodate both the operating system and the  various user processes we therefore need to allocate main menlory in the most  efficient way possible this section explains one common method contiguous  memory allocation  the memory is usually divided into two partitions one for the resident  operating system and one for the user processes we can place the operating  system in either low memory or high memory the major factor affecting this  decision is the location of the interrupt vector since the interrupt vector is  often in low memory programmers usually place the operating system in low  memory as well thus in this text we discuss only the situation in which  the operating system resides in low memory the development of the other  situation is similar  we usually want several user processes to reside in memory at the same  time we therefore need to consider how to allocate available memory to the  processes that are in the input queue waiting to be brought into memory    in contiguous memory allocation each process is contained in a single  contiguous section of memory   memory mapping and protection  before discussing memory allocation further we must discuss the issue of  memory mapping and protection we can provide these features by using a  relocation register as discussed in section  together with a limit register  as discussed in section  the relocation register contaitls the value of  the smallest physical address the limit register contains the range of logical  addresses for example relocation and limit  with relocation  and limit registers each logical address must be less than the limit register the  mmu maps the logical address dynamically by adding the value in the relocation  register this mapped address is sent to memory figure   when the cpu scheduler selects a process for execution the dispatcher  loads the relocation and limit registers with the correct values as part of the  context switch because every address generated by a cpu is checked against  these registers we can protect both the operating system and the other users  programs and data from being modified by this running process  the relocation register scheme provides an effective way to allow the  operating system s size to change dynamically this flexibility is desirable in  many situations for example the operating system contains code and buffer  space for device drivers if a device driver or other operating system service  is not commonly used we do not want to keep the code and data in memory as  we might be able to use that space for other purposes such code is sometimes  called transient operating system code it comes and goes as needed thus  using this code changes the size of the operating system during program  execution   memory allocation  now we are ready to turn to memory allocation one of the simplest  methods for allocating memory is to divide memory into several fixed sized  each partition may contain exactly one process thus the degree  no  trap addressing error  figure hardware supportfor relocation and limit registers   chapter  of multiprogramming is bound by the number of partitions in this  when a partition is free a process is selected from the input  queue and is loaded into the free partition when the process terminates the  partition becomes available for another process this method was originally  used by the ibm os operating system called mft it is no longer in use  the method described next is a generalization of the fixed partition scheme   called mvt it is used primarily in batch environments many of the ideas  presented here are also applicable to a time sharing environment in which  pure segmentation is used for memory management section   in the scheme the operating system keeps a table  indicating which parts of memory are available and which are occupied  initially all memory is available for user processes and is considered one  large block of available memory a eventually as you will see memory  contains a set of holes of various sizes  as processes enter the system they are put into an input queue the  operating system takes into account the memory requirements of each process  and the amount of available memory space in determining which processes are  allocated memory when a process is allocated space it is loaded into memory  and it can then compete for cpu time when a process terminates it releases its  memory which the operating system may then fill with another process from  the input queue  at any given time then we have a list of available block sizes and an  input queue the operating system can order the input queue according to  a scheduling algorithm memory is allocated to processes untit finally the  memory requirements of the next process cannot be satisfied that is no  available block of memory or hole is large enough to hold that process the  operating system can then wait until a large enough block is available or it can  skip down the input queue to see whether the smaller memory requirements  of some other process can be met  in generat as mentioned the memory blocks available comprise a set of  holes of various sizes scattered throughout memory when a process arrives  and needs memory the system searches the set for a hole that is large enough  for this process if the hole is too large it is split into two parts one part is  allocated to the arriving process the other is returned to the set of holes when  a process terminates it releases its block of memory which is then placed back  in the set of holes if the new hole is adjacent to other holes these adjacent holes  are merged to form one larger hole at this point the system may need to check  whether there are processes waiting for memory and whether this newly freed  and recombined memory could satisfy the demands of any of these waiting  processes  this procedure is a particular instance of the general  which concerns how to satisfy a request of size n from a  there are many solutions to this problem the  and strategies are the ones most commonly used to select a free hole  from the set of available holes  first fit allocate the first hole that is big enough searching can start either  at the beginning of the set of holes or at the location where the previous  first fit search ended we can stop searching as soon as we find a free hole  that is large enough    best fit allocate the smallest hole that is big enough we must search the  entire list unless the list is ordered by size this strategy produces the  smallest leftover hole  worst fit allocate the largest hole again we must search the entire list  unless it is sorted by size this strategy produces the largest leftover hole  which may be more useful than the smaller leftover hole from a best fit  approach  simulations have shown that both first fit and best fit are better than worst  fit in terms of decreasing time and storage utilization neither first fit nor best  fit is clearly better than the other in terms of storage utilization but first fit is  generally faster   fragmentation  both the first fit and best fit strategies for memory allocation suffer from  external as processes are loaded and removed from memory  the free memory space is broken into little pieces external fragmentation exists  when there is enough total memory space to satisfy a request but the available  spaces are not contiguous storage is fragmented into a large number of small  holes this fragmentation problem can be severe in the worst case we could  have a block of free or wasted memory between every two processes if all  these small pieces of memory were in one big free block instead we might be  able to run several more processes  whether we are using the first fit or best fit strategy can affect the amount  of fragmentation first fit is better for some systems whereas best fit is better  for others another factor is which end of a free block is allocated which is  the leftover piece the one on the top or the one on the bottom no matter  which algorithm is used however external fragmentation will be a problem  depending on the total amount of memory storage and the average process  size external fragmentation may be a minor or a major problem statistical  analysis of first fit for instance reveals that even with some optimization  given n allocated blocks another n blocks will be lost to fragmentation  that is one third of memory may be unusable this property is known as the  memory fragmentation can be internal as well as external consider a  multiple partition allocation scheme with a hole of bytes suppose that  the next process requests bytes if we allocate exactly the requested block  we are left with a hole of bytes the overhead to keep track of this hole will be  substantially larger than the hole itself the general approach to avoiding this  problem is to break the physical memory into fixed sized blocks and allocate  memory in units based on block size with this approach the memory allocated  to a process may be slightly larger than the requested memory the difference  between these two numbers is internal memory that  is internal to a partition  one solution to the problem of external fragmentation is the  goal is to shuffle the memory contents so as to place all free n lemory together  in one large block compaction is not always possible however if relocation  is static and is done at assembly or load time compaction cannot be done  compaction is possible only if relocation is dynamic and is done at execution   chapter   time if addresses are relocated dynamically relocation requires only moving  the program and data and then changing the base register to reflect the new  base address when compaction is possible we must determine its cost the  simplest compaction algorithm is to move all processes toward one end of  memory all holes move in the other direction producing one large hole of  available memory this scheme can be expensive  another possible solution to the external fragmentation problem is to  permit the logical address space of the processes to be noncontiguous thus  allowing a process to be allocated physical memory wherever such memory  is available two complementary techniques achieve this solution paging   section and segmentation section  these techniques can also be  combined section   is a memory management scheme that permits the physical address  space a process to be noncontiguous paging avoids external fragmentation  and the need for compaction it also solves the considerable problem of  fitting memory chunks of varying sizes onto the backin g store most memory\\xad management schemes used before the introduction of paging suffered from  this problem the problem arises because when some code fragments or data  residing in main memory need to be swapped out space must be fmmd on  the backing store the backing store has the same fragmentation problems  discussed in connection with main memory but access is much slower so  compaction is impossible because of its advantages over earlier methods  paging in its various forms is used in most operating systems  physical  address foooo •  f   page table  figure paging hardware    physical  memory    traditionally support for paging has been handled by hardware however  recent designs have implemented paging by closely integrating the hardware  and operating system especially on bit microprocessors   basic method  the basic method for implementing paging involves breaking physical mem\\xad ory into fixed sized blocks called harnes and breaking logical memory into  blocks of the same size called when a process is to be executed its  pages are loaded into any available memory frames from their source a file  system or the backing store the backing store is divided into fixed sized  blocks that are of the san e size as the memory frames  the hardware support for paging is illustrated in figure every address  generated the cpu is divided into two parts a p and a   the page number is used as an index into a the  page table contains the base address of each page in physical memory this  base address is combined with the page offset to define the physical memory  address that is sent to the memory unit the paging model of memory is shown  in figure  the page size like the frame size is defined by the hardware the size  of a page is typically a power of varying between bytes and mb per  page depending on the computer architecture the selection of a power of as  a page size makes the translation of a logical address into a page number and  page offset particularly easy if the size of the logical address space is m and  a page size is addressing units bytes or wordst then the high order m n  bits of a logical address designate the page number and the n low order bits  designate the page offset thus the logical address is as follows  logical  memory w  page table frame  number  physical  memory  figure paging model of logical and physical memory   chapter  page number page offset  d  m n n  where p is an index into the page table and d is the displacement within the  page  as a concrete although minuscule example consider the memory in  figure here in the logical address n and m  using a page size  of bytes and a physical memory of bytes pages we show how the  user s view of memory can be mapped into physical memory logical address   is page offset indexing into the page table we find that page is in frame   thus logical address maps to physical address  x  logical  address page offset maps to physical address  x  logical  address is page offset according to the page table page is mapped to  frame thus logical address maps to physical address   x  o  logical address maps to physical address  you may have noticed that paging itself is a form of dynamic relocation  every logical address is bound by the paging hardware to some physical  address using paging is similar to using a table of base or relocation registers  one for each frame of memory   m    page table  logical memory  physical memory  figure paging example for a byte memory with byte pages    when we use a paging scheme we have no external fragmentation any free  frame can be allocated to a process that needs it however we may have some  internal fragmentation notice that frames are allocated as units if the memory  requirements of a process do not happen to coincide with page boundaries  the last frame allocated may not be completely full for example if page size  is bytes a process of bytes will need pages plus bytes it  will be allocated frames resulting in internal fragmentation of    bytes in the worst case a process would need pages plus byte it  would be allocated  frames resulting in internal fragmentation of almost  an entire frame  if process size is independent of page size we expect internal fragmentation  to average one half page per process this consideration suggests that small  page sizes are desirable however overhead is involved in each page table  entry and this overhead is reduced as the size of the pages increases also  disk i is more efficient when the amount data being transferred is larger   chapter generally page sizes have grown over time as processes data  sets and main memory have become larger today pages typically are between   kb and kb in size and some systems support even larger page sizes some  cpus and kernels even support multiple page sizes for instance solaris uses  page sizes of kb and mb depending on the data stored by the pages  researchers are now developing support for variable on the fly page size  usually each page table entry is bytes long but that size can vary as well  a bit entry can point to one of physical page frames if frame size is kb  then a system with byte entries can address bytes or tb of physical  memory  when a process arrives in the system to be executed its size expressed  in pages is examined each page of the process needs one frame thus if the  process requires pages at least frames must be available in memory if n  frames are available they are allocated to this arriving process the first page  of the process is loaded injo one of the allocated frames and the frame number  is put in the page table for this process the next page is loaded into another  frame its frame number is put into the page table and so on figure   an important aspect of paging is the clear separation between the user s  view of memory and the actual physical memory the user program views  memory as one single space containing only this one program in fact the user  program is scattered throughout physical memory which also holds other  programs the difference between the user s view of memory and the actual  physical memory is reconciled by the address translation hardware the logical  addresses are translated into physical addresses this mapping is hidden from  the user and is controlled by the operating system notice that the user process  by definition is unable to access memory it does not own it has no way of  addressing memory outside of its page table and the table includes only those  pages that the process owns  since the operating system is managing physical memory it must be aware  of the allocation details of physical memory which frames are allocated  which frames are available how many total frames there are and so on this  information is generally kept in a data structure called a frame the frame  table has one entry for each physical page frame indicating whether the latter  is free or allocated and if it is allocated to which page of which process or  processes   chapter  free frame list free frame list                            new process page table   a b  figure free frames a before allocation and b after allocation  in addition the operating system must be aware that user processes operate  in user space and all logical addresses must be mapped to produce physical  addresses if a user makes a system call to do i for example and provides  an address as a parameter a buffer for instance that address must be mapped  to produce the correct physical address the operating system maintains a copy  of the page table for each process just as it maintains a copy of the instruction  counter and register contents this copy is used to translate logical addresses to  physical addresses whenever the operating system must map a logical address  to a physical address manually it is also used by the cpu dispatcher to define  the hardware page table when a process is to be allocated the cpu paging  therefore increases the context switch time   hardware support  each operating system has its own methods for storing page tables most  allocate a page table for each process a pointer to the page table is stored with  the other register values like the instruction counter in the process control  block when the dispatcher is told to start a process it must reload the user  registers and define the correct hardware page table values from the stored  user page table  the hardware implementation of the page table can be done in several  in the simplest case the page table is implemented as a set of dedicated  these registers should be built with very high speed logic to make the  paging address translation efficient every access to memory nlust go through  the paging map so efficiency is a major consideration the cpu dispatcher  reloads these registers just as it reloads the other registers instructions to load  or modify the page table registers are of course privileged so that only the  operating system can change the memory map the dec pdp is an example  of such an architecture the address consists of bits and the page size is  kb the page table thus consists of eight entries that are kept in fast registers    the use of registers for the page table is satisfactory if the page table is  reasonably sncall for example entries most contemporary computers  however allow the page table to be very large for example million entries  for these machines the use of fast registers to implement the page table is  not feasible rather the page table is kept in main memory and a  points to the page table changing page tables requires  changing only this one register substantially reducing context switch time  the problem with this approach is the time required to access a user  memory location if we want to access location i we must first index into  the page table using the value in the ptbr offset by the page number fori this  task requires a memory access it provides us with the frame number which  is combined with the page offset to produce the actual address we can then  access the desired place in memory with this scheme two memory accesses are  needed to access a byte one for the page table entry one for the byte thus  memory access is slowed by a factor of this delay would be intolerable under  most circumstances we might as well resort to swapping  the standard solution to this problem is to use a special small fast\\xad lookup hardware cache called a bc her the tlb  is associative high speed memory each entry in the tlb consists of two parts  a key or tag and a value when the associative memory is presented with an  item the item is compared with all keys simultaneously if the item is found  the corresponding value field is returned the search is fast the hardware  however is expensive typically the number of entries in a tlb is small often  numbering between and  the tlb is used with page tables in the following way the tlb contains  only a few of the page table entries when a logical address is generated by  the cpu its page number is presented to the tlb if the page number is found  its frame number is immediately available and is used to access memory the  whole task may take less than percent longer than it would if an unmapped  memory reference were used  if the page number is not in the tlb known as a a memory  reference to the page table must be made when the frame number is obtained  we can use it to access memory figure  in addition we add the page  number and frame number to the tlb so that they will be found quickly on the  next reference if the tlb is already full of entries the operating system must  select one for replacement replacement policies range from least recently  used lru to random furthermore some tlbs allow certain entries to be  meaning that they cannot be removed from the tlb typically  tlb entries for kernel code are wired down  some tlbs store in each tlb entry an  asid uniquely identifies each process and is used to provide address space  protection for that process when the tlb attempts to resolve virtual page  numbers it ensures that the asid for the currently running process matches the  asid associated with the virtual page if the asids do not match the attempt is  treated as a tlb miss in addition to providing address space protection an asid  allows the tlb to contain entries for several different processes simultaneously  if the tlb does not support separate asids then every time a new table  is selected for instance with each context switch the tlb must   or erased to ensure that the next executing process does not use the wrong  translation information otherwise the tlb could include old entries that   chapter  tlb hit  tlb  p  tlb miss  page table  figure paging hardware with tlb physical  memory  contain valid virtual addresses but have incorrect or invalid physical addresses  left over from the previous process  the percentage of times that a particular page number is found in the tlb  is called the an percent hit ratio for example means that we  find the desired page number in the tlb percent of the time if it takes  nanoseconds to search the tlb and nanoseconds to access memory then  a mapped memory access takes nanoseconds when the page number is  in the tlb if we fail to find the page number in the tlb nanoseconds  then we must first access memory for the page table and frame number  nanoseconds and then access the desired byte in memory nanoseconds  for a total of nanoseconds to find the effective we  weight the case by its probability  effective access time  x  x   nanoseconds  in this example we suffer a percent slowdown in memory access time from   to nanoseconds  for a percent hit ratio we have  effective access time  x  x   nanoseconds  this increased hit rate produces only a percent slowdown in access time  we will further explore the impact of the hit ratio on the tlb in chapter     protection  memory protection in a paged environment is accomplished by protection bits  associated with each frame normally these bits are kept in the page table  one bit can define a page to be read write or read only every reference  to memory goes through the page table to find the correct frame nuncber at  the same time that the physical address is being computed the protection bits  can be checked to verify that no writes are being made to a read only page an  attempt to write to a read only page causes a hardware trap to the operating  system or memory protection violation  we can easily expand this approach to provide a finer level of protection  we can create hardware to provide read only read write or execute only  protection or by providing separate protection bits for each kind of access we  can allow any combination of these accesses illegal attempts will be trapped  to the operating system  one additional bit is generally attached to each entry in the page table a  bit when this bit is set to valid the associated page is in the  process s logical address space and is thus a legal or valid page when the bit  is set to invalid the page is not in the process s logical address space illegal  addresses are trapped by use of the valid invalid bit the operating system  sets this bit for each page to allow or disallow access to the page  suppose for example that in a system with a bit address space to   we have a program that should use only addresses to given  a page size of kb we have the situation shown in figure addresses in    frame number j valid invalid bit            page n  figure i valid v or invalid i bit in a page table   chapter  pages   and are mapped normally through the page table any  attempt to generate an address in pages or however will find that the  valid invalid bit is set to invalid and the computer will trap to flee operating  system invalid page reference  notice that this scheme has created a problem because the program  extends only to address any reference beyond that address is illegal  however references to page are classified as valid so accesses to addresses  up to are valid only the addresses from to are invalid this  problem is a result of the kb page size and reflects the internal fragmentation  of paging  rarely does a process use all its address range in fact many processes  use only a small fraction of the address space available to them it would be  wasteful in these cases to create a page table with entries for every page in the  address range most of this table would be unused but would take up valuable  memory space some systems provide hardware in the form of a  length to indicate the size of the page table value is  checked against every logical address to verify that the address is in the valid  range for the process failure of this test causes an error trap to the operating  system   shared pages  an advantage of paging is the possibility of sharing common code this con\\xad sideration is particularly important in a time sharing environment consider a  system that supports users each of whom executes a text editor if the text  editor consists of kb of code and kb of data space we need kb to  support the users if the code is or pure however it  can be shared as shown in figure here we see a three page editor each  page kb in size the large page size is used to simplify the figure being  shared among three processes each process has its own data page  reentrant code is non self modifying code it never changes during execu\\xad tion thus two or more processes can execute the same code at the same time  each process has its own copy of registers and data storage to hold the data for  the process s execution the data for two different processes wilt of course be  different  only one copy of the editor need be kept in physical memory each user s  page table maps onto the same physical copy of the editor but data pages are  mapped onto different frames thus to support users we need only one  copy of the editor kb plus copies of the kb of data space per user  the total space required is now kb instead of kb a significant  savings  other heavily used programs can also be shared compilers window  systems run time libraries database systems and so on to be sharable the  code must be reentrant the read only nature of shared code should not be  left to the correctness of the code the operating system should enforce this  property  the sharing of memory among processes on a system is similar to the  sharing of the address space of a task by threads described in chapter  furthermore recall that in chapter we described shared memory as a method   ed    ed  ed  data  process p  process p page table  for p  page table  for p  ed  ed  ed  data  process p  data   data   ed  ed  ed       data page table  for p          figure sharing of code in a paging environment  of interprocess corrununication some operating systems implement shared  memory using shared pages  organizing memory according to pages provides numerous benefits in  addition to allowing several processes to share the same physical pages we  cover several other benefits in chapter  in this section we explore some of the most common techniques for structuring  the page table   hierarchical paging  most modern computer systems support a large logical address space   to in such an environment the page table itself becomes excessively  large for example consider a system with a bit logical address space if  the page size in such a system is kb  then a page table may consist of  up to million entries  assuming that each entry consists of bytes  each process may need up to mb of physical address space for the page table  alone clearly we would not want to allocate the page table contiguously in  main memory one simple solution to this problem is to divide the page table  into smaller pieces we can accomplish this division in several ways  one way is to use a two level paging algorithm in which the page table  itself is also paged figure  for example consider again the system with   chapter    page table  memory  figure a two level page table scheme  a bit logical address space and a page size of kb a logical address is  divided into a page number consisting of bits and a page offset consisting  of bits because we page the page table the page number is further divided  into a bit page number and a bit page offset thus a logical address is as  follows  page number page offset  d    where p is an index into the outer page table and p is the displacement  within the page of the outer page table the address translation method for this  architecture is shown in figure because address translation works from  the outer page table inward this scheme is also known as a  the vax architecture supports a variation of two level paging the vax is  a bit machine with a page size of bytes the logical address space of a  process is divided into four equal sections each of which consists of bytes  each section represents a different part of the logical address space of a process  the first high order bits of the logical address designate the appropriate  section the next bits represent the logical page number of that section and  the final bits represent an offset in the desired page by partitioning the page  outer page  table  figure address translation for a two level bit paging architecture  table in this manner the operating system can leave partitions unused until a  process needs them an address on the vax architecture is as follows  section page offset  s p d    where s designates the section number p is an index into the page table and d  is the displacement within the page even when this scheme is used the size  of a one level page table for a vax process using one section is bits  bytes per entry mb to further reduce main memory use the vax pages the  user process page tables  for a system with a bit logical address space a two level paging scheme  is no longer appropriate to illustrate this point let us suppose that the page  size in such a system is kb  in this case the page table consists of up  to entries if we use a two level paging scheme then the iml er page tables  can conveniently be one page long or contain byte entries the addresses  look like this  outer page inner page offset  the outer page table consists of entries or bytes the obvious way to  avoid such a large table is to divide the outer page table into smaller pieces   this approach is also used on some bit processors for added flexibility and  efficiency  we can divide the outer page table in various ways we can page the outer  page table giving us a three level paging scheme suppose that the outer page  table is made up of standard size pages entries or bytes in this case  a bit address space is still daunting  nd outer page outer page inner page offset  the outer page table is sti bytes in size  chapter  the next step would be a four level paging scheme where the second level  outer page table itself is also paged and so forth the bit ultrasparc would  require seven levels of paging a prohibitive number of memory accesses\\xad to translate each logical address you can see from this example why for bit  architectures hierarchical page tables are generally considered inappropriate  hashed page tables  a common approach for handling address spaces larger than bits is to use  a with the hash value being the virtual page number each  entry in the hash table contains a linked list of elements that hash to the same  location to handle collisions each element consists of three fields  the  virtual page number  the value of the mapped page frame and a pointer  to the next element in the linked list  the algorithm works as follows the virtual page number in the virtual  address is hashed into the hash table the virtual page number is compared  with field in the first element in the linked list if there is a match the  corresponding page frame field is used to form the desired physical address  if there is no match subsequent entries in the linked list are searched for a  matching virtual page number this scheme is shown in figure  a variation of this scheme that is favorable for bit address spaces has  been proposed this variation uses which are similar to  hashed page tables except that each entry in the hash table refers to several  pages such as rather than a single page therefore a single page table  entry can store the mappings for multiple physical page frames clustered  page tables are particularly useful for address spaces where memory  references are noncontiguous and scattered throughout the address space   inverted page tables  usually each process has an associated page table the page table has one  entry for each page that the process is using or one slot for each virtual  hash table  figure hashed page table physical  address  physical  memory    address regardless of the latter s validity this table representation is a natural  one since processes reference pages through the pages virtual addresses the  operating system must then translate this reference into a physical memory  address since the table is sorted by virtual address the operating system is  able to calculate where in the table the associated physical address entry is  located and to use that value directly one of the drawbacks of this method  is that each page table may consist of millions of entries these tables may  consume large amounts of physical memory just to keep track of how other  physical memory is being used  to solve this problem we can use an page an inverted  page table has one entry for each real page or frame of memory each entry  consists of the virtual address of the page stored in that real memory location  with information about the process that owns the page thus only one page  table is in the system and it has only one entry for each page of physical  memory figure shows the operation of an inverted page table compare  it with figure which depicts a standard page table in operation inverted  page tables often require that an address space identifier section  be  stored in each entry of the page table since the table usually contains several  different address spaces mapping physical memory storing the address space  identifier ensures that a logical page for a particular process is mapped to the  corresponding physical page frame examples of systems using inverted page  tables include the bit ultrasparc and powerpc  to illustrate this method we describe a simplified version of the iverted  page table used in the ibm rt each virtual address in the system consists of a  triple   process id page number offset  each inverted page table entry is a pair process id page number where the  process id assumes the role of the address space identifier when a memory  page table physical  address  figure inverted page table physical  memory   chapter   reference occurs part of the virtual address consisting of process id page\\xad number is presented to the memory subsystem the inverted page table  is then searched for a match if a match is found say at entry i then the  physical address i offset is generated if no match is found then an illegal  address access has been attempted  although this scheme decreases the amount of memory needed to store  each page table it increases the amount of time needed to search the table when  a page reference occurs because the inverted page table is sorted by physical  address but lookups occur on virtual addresses the whole table might need to  be searched for a match this search would take far too long to alleviate this  problem we use a hash table as described in section  to limit the search  to one or at most a few page table entries of course each access to the  hash table adds a memory reference to the procedure so one virtual memory  reference requires at least two real memory reads one for the hash table entry  and one for the page table recall that the tlb is searched first before the hash  table is consulted offering some performance improvement  systems that use inverted page tables have difficulty implementing shared  memory shared memory is usually implemented as multiple virtual addresses   one for each process sharing the memory that are mapped to one physical  address this standard method cannot be used with inverted page tables  because there is only one virtual page entry for every physical page one  physical page cannot have two or more shared virtual addresses a simple  technique for addressing this issue is to allow the page table to contain only  one mapping of a virtual address to the shared physical address this means  that references to virtual addresses that are not mapped result in page faults  an important aspect of memory management that became unavoidable with  paging is the separation of the user s view of memory from the actual physical  memory as we have already seen the user s view of memory is not the  same as the actual physical memory the user s view is mapped onto physical  memory this mapping allows differentiation between logical memory and  physical memory   basic method  do users think of memory as a linear array of bytes some containing  instructions and others containing data most people would say no rather  users prefer to view memory as a collection of variable sized segments with  no necessary ordering among segments figure   consider how you think of a program when you are writing it you think  of it as a main program with a set of methods procedures or functions it  may also include various data structures objects arrays stacks variables and  so on each of these modules or data elements is referred to by name you  talk about the stack the math library the n ain program without caring  what addresses in memory these elements occupy you are not concerned  with whether the stack is stored before or after the sqrt function each  of these segments is of variable length the length is intrinsically defined by  subroutine  symbol  table  ·  main  program  logical address  figure user s view of a program  the purpose of the segment in the program elements within a segment are  identified by their offset from the begim ing of the segment the first statement  of the program the seventh stack frame entry in the stack the fifth instruction  of the sqrt  and so on  is a memory management scheme that supports this user  view of memory a logical address space is a collection of segments each  segment has a name and a length the addresses specify both the segment name  and the offset within the segment the user therefore specifies each address  by two quantities a segment name and an offset contrast this scheme with  the paging scheme in which the user specifies only a single address which is  partitioned by the hardware into a page number and an offset all invisible to  the programmer  for simplicity of implementation segments are numbered and are referred  to by a segn lent number rather than by a segment name thus a logical address  consists of a two tuple   segment number offset  normally the user program is compiled and the compiler automatically  constructs segments reflecting the input program  a c compiler might create separate segments for the following  the code  global variables  the heap from which memory is allocated  the stacks used by each thread  the standard c library   chapter    no segment  table  yes  trap addressing error  figure segmentation hardware physical memory  libraries that are linked in during compile time might be assign ed separate  segments the loader would take all these segments and assign them segment  numbers   hardware  although the user can now refer to objects in the program by a two dimensional  address the actual physical memory is still of course a one dimensional  sequence of bytes thus we must define an implementation to map two\\xad dimensional user defined addresses into one dimensional physical addresses  this mapping is effected by a each entry in the segment table  has a segment base and a segment limit the segment base contains the startilcg  physical address where the segment resides in memory and the segment limit  specifies the length of the segment  the use of a segment table is illustrated in figure a logical address  consists of two parts a segment number s and an offset into that segment d  the segment number is used as an index to the segment table the offset d of  the logical address must be between and the segment limit if it is not we trap  to the operating system logical addressing attempt beyond end of segment  when an offset is legal it is added to the segment base to produce the address  in physical memory of the desired byte the segment table is thus essentially  an array of base limit register pairs  as an example consider the situation shown in figure we have five  segments numbered from through the segments are stored in physical  memory as shown the segment table has a separate entry for each segment  giving the beginning address of the segment in physical memory or base and  the length of that segment or limit for example segment is bytes long  and begins at location thus a reference to byte of segment is mapped   subroutine  segment o  segment symbol  table  segment  main  program  segment  logical address space         limit base            segment table  figure example of segmentation   segment o       segment      segment  segment   f       s gt e it    physical memory  onto location  a reference to segment byte is mapped to   the base of segment   a reference to byte of segment   would result in a trap to the operating system as this segment is only tooo  bytes long  both paging and segmentation have advantages and disadvantages in fact  some architectures provide both in this section we discuss the intel pentium  architecture which supports both pure segmentation and segmentation with  paging we do not give a complete description of the memory management  structure of the pentium in this text rather we present the major ideas on  which it is based we conclude our discussion with an overview of linux  address translation on pentium systems  in pentium systems the cpu generates logical addresses which are given  to the segmentation unit the segmentation unit produces a linear address for  each logical address the linear address is then given to the paging unit which  in turn generates the physical address in main memory thus the segmentation  and paging units form the equivalent of the memory management unit mmu  this scheme is shown in figure   pentium segmentation  the pentium architecture allows a segment to be as large as gb and the  maximum number of segments per process is k the logical address space   chapter  i cpu i  figure logical to physical address translation in the pentium  of a process is divided into two partitions the first partition consists of up to   k segments that are private to that process the second partition consists of  up to k segments that are shared all the processes information about  the first partition is kept in the information about  the second partition is kept in the each entry  in the ldt and gdt consists of an byte segment descriptor with detailed  information about a particular segment including the base location and limit  of that segment  the logical address is a pair selector offset where the selector is a bit  number  g p    in which s designates the segment number g indicates whether the segment is  in the gdt or ldt and p deals with protection the offset is a bit number  specifying the location of the byte or word within the segment in question  the machine has six segment registers allowing six segments to be  addressed at any one time by a process it also has six byte microprogram  registers to hold the corresponding descriptors from either the ldt or gdt  this cache lets the pentium avoid having to read the descriptor from memory  for every memory reference  the linear address on the pentium is bits long and is formed as follows  the segment register points to the appropriate entry in the ldt or gdt the  base and limit information about the segment in question is used to generate  a first the limit is used to check for address validity if the  address is not valid a memory fault is generated resulting in a trap to the  operating system if it is valid then the value of the offset is added to the value  of the base resulting in a bit linear address this is shown in figure in  the following section we discuss how the paging unit turns this linear address  into a physical address   pentium paging  the pentium architecture allows a page size of either kb or mb for kb  pages the pentium uses a two level paging schence in which the division of  the bit linear address is as follows  page number page offset  d    the address translation scheme for this architecture is similar to the scheme  shown in figure the intel pentium address translation is shown in more    logical address offset     bit linear address  figure intel pentium segmentation  detail in figure the high order bits reference an entry in the outern lost  page table which the pentium terms the page directory the cr register  points to the page directory for the current process the page directory entry  points to an inner page table that is indexed by the contents of the innermost   bits in the linear address finally the low order bits refer to the offset  in the kb page pointed to in the page table  one entry in the page directory is the page size flag which if set\\xad indicates that the size of the page frame is mb and not the standard kb  if this flag is set the page directory points directly to the mb page frame  bypassing the inner page table and the low order bits in the linear address  refer to the offset in the mb page frame    cr \\xad registe r page directory  page  directory  page directory logical address  page table   l  page  table  i  offset   offset  j   kb  page   mb  page  figure paging in the pentium architecture    l chapter  to improve the efficiency of physical memory use intel pentium page  tables can be swapped to disk in this case an invalid bit is used in the page  directory entry to indicate whether the table to which the entry is pointing is  in memory or on disk if the table is on disk the operating system can use  the other bits to specify the disk location of the table the table then can be  brought into memory on demand   linux on pentium systems  as an illustration consider the linux operating system running on the intel  pentium architecture because linux is designed to run on a variety of proces\\xad sors many of which may provide only limited support for segmentation\\xad linux does not rely on segmentation and uses it minimally on the pentium  linux uses only six segments  a segment for kernel code  a segment for kernel data  a segment for user code  a segment for user data  a task state segment tss  i a default ldt segment  the segments for user code and user data are shared by all processes  running in user mode this is possible because all processes use the same logical  address space and all segment descriptors are stored in the global descriptor  table gdt furthermore each process has its own task state segment tss  and the descriptor for this segment is stored in the gdt the tss is used to store  the hardware context of each process during context switches the default ldt  segment is normally shared by all processes and is usually not used however  if a process requires its own ldt it can create one and use that instead of the  default ldt  as noted each segment selector includes a bit field for protection thus  the pentium allows four levels of protection of these four levels limlx only  recognizes two user mode and kernel mode  although the pentium uses a two level paging model linux is designed  to run on a variety of hardware platforms many of which are bit platforms  where two level paging is not plausible therefore linux has adopted a three\\xad level paging strategy that works well for both bit and bit architectures  the linear address in linux is broken into the following four parts  global  directory middle  directory page  table  figure highlights the three level paging model in linux  the number of bits in each part of the linear address varies according  to architecture however as described earlier in this section the pentium  architecture only uses a two level paging model how then does linux apply   lglobal directory  global  directory  cr  c   l  register   linear address  middle directory  figure three level paging in linux offset  page  frame  its three level model on the pentium in this situation the size of the middle  directory is zero bits effectively bypassing the middle directory  each task in linux has its own set of page tables and just as in figure   the cr register points to the global directory for the task currently executing  during a context switch the value of the cr register is saved and restored in  the tss segments of the tasks involved in the context switch  memory management algorithms for multiprogrammed operating systems  range from the simple single user system approach to paged segmentation  the most important determinant of the method used in a particular system is  the hardware provided every memory address generated by the cpu must be  checked for legality and possibly mapped to a physical address the checking  cannot be implemented efficiently in software hence we are constrained by  the hardware available  the various memory management algorithms contiguous allocation pag\\xad ing segmentation and combinations of paging and segmentation differ in  many aspects in comparing different memory management strategies we use  the following considerations  hardware support a simple base register or a base limit register pair is  sufficient for the single and multiple partition schemes whereas paging  and segmentation need mapping tables to define the address map  performance as the memory management algorithm becomes more  complex the time required to map a logical address to a physical address  increases for the simple systems we need only compare or add to the  logical address operations that are fast paging and segmentation can be  as fast if the mapping table is implemented in fast registers if the table is   chapter  in memory however user memory accesses can be degraded substantially  a tlb can reduce the performance degradation to an acceptable level  fragmentation a multiprogrammed system will generally perform more  efficiently if it has a higher level of multiprogramming for a given  set of processes we can increase the multiprogramming level only by  packing more processes into memory to accomplish this task we must  reduce memory waste or fragmentation systems with fixed sized allo\\xad cation units such as the single partition scheme and paging suffer from  internal fragmentation systems with variable sized allocation units such  as the multiple partition scheme and segmentation suffer from external  fragmentation  relocation one solution to the external fragmentation problem is com\\xad paction compaction involves shifting a program in memory in such a  way that the program does not notice the change this consideration  requires that logical addresses be relocated dynamically at execution time  if addresses are relocated only at load time we cannot compact storage  swapping swapping can be added to any algorithm at intervals deter\\xad mined by the operating system usually dictated by cpu scheduling poli\\xad cies processes are copied from main memory to a backing store and later  are copied back to main memory this scheme allows more processes to be  run than can be fit into memory at one time  sharing another means of increasing the multiprogramming level is to  share code and data among different users sharing generally requires  that either paging or segmentation be used to provide small packets of  information pages or segments that can be shared sharing is a means  of running many processes with a limited amount of memory but shared  programs and data must be designed carefully  protection if paging or segmentation is provided different sections of a  user program can be declared execute only read only or read write this  restriction is necessary with shared code or data and is generally useful  in any case to provide simple run time checks for common programming  errors   explain the difference between internal and external fragmentation   compare the memory organization schemes of contiguous memory

required by the address translation structures in order to  convert virtual addresses to physical addresses   consider a system in which a program can be separated into two  parts code and data the

program will require using the appropriate data type to  store bits we encourage you to use unsigned data types as well  dynamic storage allocation was discussed by knuth  section  who  found through simulation results that first fit is generally superior to best fit  knuth also discussed the percent rule  the concept of paging can be credited to the designers of the atlas system  which has been

limx systems is  presented in bovet and cesati     c er  in chapter we discussed various memory management strategies used in  computer systems all these strategies have the same goal to keep many  processes in memory simultaneously to allow multiprogramming however  they tend to require that an entire process be in memory before it can execute  virtual memory is a tecrucique that allows the execution of processes  that are not completely in memory one major advantage of this scheme is  that programs can be larger than physical memory further virtual memory  abstracts main memory into an extremely large uniform array of storage  separating logical memory as viewed by the user from physical memory  this technique frees programmers from the concerns of memory storage  limitations virtual memory also allows processes to share files easily and  to implement shared memory in addition it provides an efficient mechanism  for process creation virtual memory is not easy to implement however and  may substantially decrease performance if it is used carelessly in this chapter  we discuss virtual memory in the form of demand paging and examine its  complexity and cost  to describe the benefits of a virtual memory system  to explain the concepts of demand paging page replacement algorithms  and allocation of page frames  to discuss the principles of the working set model  the memory management algorithms outlined in chapter are necessary  because of one basic requirement the instructions being executed must be  in physical memory the first approach to meeting this requirement is to place  the entire logical address space in physical memory dynamic loading can help  to ease this restriction but it generally requires special precautions and extra  work by the programmer     chapter  the requirement that instructions m ust be in physical memory to be  executed seems both necessary and reasonable but it is also unfortunate since  it limits the size of a program to the size of physical memory in fact an  examination of real programs shows us that in many cases the entire program  is not needed for instance consider the following  programs often have code to handle unusual error conditions since these  errors seldom if ever occur in practice this code is almost never executed  arrays lists and tables are often allocated more memory than they actually  need an array may be declared by elements even though it is  seldom larger than by elements an assembler symbol table may  have room for symbols although the average program has less than   symbols  certain options and features of a program may be used rarely for instance  the routines on u s government computers that balance the budget have  not been used in many years  even in those cases where the entire program is needed it may not all be  needed at the same time  the ability to execute a program that is only partially in memory would  confer many benefits  a program would no longer be constrained by the amount of physical  memory that is available users would be able to write programs for an  extremely large virtual address space simplifying the programming task  page  page  page  page v  virtual  memory memory  map  physical  memory  figure diagram showing virtual memory that is larger than physical memory    because each user program could take less physical memory more  programs could be run at the sance time with a corresponding increase in  cpu utilization and throughput but with no increase in response time or  turnaround time  less i o would be needed to load or swap user programs into memory so  each user program would run faster  thus running a program that is not entirely in memory would benefit both  the system and the user  involves the separation of logical memory as perceived  by users from physical memory this separation allows an extremely large  virtual memory to be provided for programmers when only a smaller physical  memory is available figure  virtual memory makes the task of program\\xad ming much easier because the programmer no longer needs to worry about  the amount of physical memory available she can concentrate instead on the  problem to be programmed  the address space of a process refers to the logical or virtual view  of how a process is stored in memory typically this view is that a process  begins at a certain logical address say address and exists in contiguous  memory as shown in figure recall from chapter though that in fact  physical memory may be organized in page frames and that the physical page  frames assigned to a process may not be contiguous it is up to the memory\\xad management unit mmu to map logical pages to physical page frames in  memory  note in figure that we allow for the heap to grow upward in memory  as it is used for dynamic memory allocation similarly we allow for the stack to  grow downward in memory through successive function calls the large blank  space or hole between the heap and the stack is part of the virtual address  figure virtual address space   chapter  space but will require actual physical pages only if the heap or stack grows  virtual address spaces that include holes are known as sparse address spaces  using a sparse address space is beneficial because the holes can be filled as the  stack or heap segments grow or if we wish to dynam ically link libraries or  possibly other shared objects during program execution  in addition to separating logical memory from physical memory virtual  memory allows files and memory to be shared by two or more processes  through page sharing section  this leads to the following benefits  system libraries can be shared by several processes through mapping  of the shared object into a virtual address space although each process  considers the shared libraries to be part of its virtual address space the  actual pages where the libraries reside in physical memory are shared by  all the processes figure  typically a library is mapped read only into  the space of each process that is linked with it  similarly virtual memory enables processes to share memory recall from  chapter that two or more processes can communicate through the use  of shared memory virtual memory allows one process to create a region  of memory that it can share with another process processes sharing this  region consider it part of their virtual address space yet the actual physical  pages of memory are shared much as is illustrated in figure  virtual memory can allow pages to be shared during process creation with  the fork system calt thus speeding up process creation  we further explore these and other benefits of virtual memory later in  this chapter first though we discuss implementing virtual memory through  demand paging  shared library shared  pages shared library  figure shared library using virtual memory     consider how an executable program might be loaded from disk into n lemory  one option is to load the entire program in physical memory at program  execution time however a problent with this approach is that we may not  initially need the entire program in memory suppose a program starts with  a list of available options from which the user is to select loading the entire  program into memory results in loading the executable code for all options  regardless of whether an option is ultimately selected by the user or not an  alternative strategy is to load pages only as they are needed this technique is  known as paging and is commonly used in virtual memory systems  with demand paged virtual memory pages are only loaded when they are  demanded during program execution pages that are never accessed are thus  never loaded into physical memory  a demand paging system is similar to a paging system with swapping   figure where processes reside in secondary memory usually a disk  when we want to execute a process we swap it into memory rather than  swapping the entire process into memory however we use a a  lazy swapper never swaps a page into memory unless that page will be needed  since we are now viewing a process as a sequence of pages rather than as one  large contiguous address space use of the term swapper is technically incorrect  a swapper manipulates entire processes whereas a is concerned with  the individual pages of a process we thus use pager rather than swapper in  connection with demand paging  program  a  program  b  main  memory swap out  so    swap in  figure transfer of a paged memory to contiguous disk space   chapter   basic concepts  when a process is to be swapped in the pager guesses which pages will be  used before the process is swapped out again instead of swapping in a whole  process the pager brings only those pages into memory thus it avoids reading  into memory pages that will not be used anyway decreasing the swap time  and the amount of physical memory needed  with this scheme we need some form of hardware support to distinguish  between the pages that are in memory and the pages that are on the disk  the valid invalid bit scheme described in section can be used for this  purpose this time however when this bit is set to valid the associated page  is both legal and in n emory if the bit is set to invalid the page either is not  valid that is not in the logical address space of the process or is valid but  is currently on the disk the page table entry for a page that is brought into  memory is set as usuat but the page table entry for a page that is not currently  in memory is either simply marked invalid or contains the address of the page  on disk this situation is depicted in figure  notice that marking a page invalid will have no effect if the process never  attempts to access that page hence if we guess right and page in all and only  those pages that are actually needed the process will run exactly as though we  had brought in all pages while the process executes and accesses pages that  are execution proceeds normally               valid invalid  frame bit  i   v  logical  memory  physical memory dod  d   j   jtb  odd  figure page table when some pages are

in handling a page fault  but what happens if the process tries to access a page that was not brought  into memory access to a page marked invalid causes a the paging  hardware in translating the address through the page table will notice that  the invalid bit is set causing a trap to the operating system this trap is the  result of the operating system s failure to bring the desired page into memory  the procedure for handling this page fault is straightforward figure   we check an internal table usually kept with the process control block  for this process to determine whether the reference was a valid or an  invalid memory access  if the reference was invalid we terminate the process if it was valid but  we have not yet brought in that page we now page it in  we find a free frame by taking one from the free frame list for example  we schedule a disk operation to read the desired page into the newly  allocated frame  when the disk read is complete we modify the internal table kept with  the process and the page table to indicate that the page is now in memory  we restart the instruction that was interrupted by the trap the process  can now access the page as though it had always been in memory  in the extreme case we can start executing a process with no pages in  memory when the operating system sets the instruction pointer to the first   chapter  instruction of the process which is on a non memory resident page the process  immediately faults for the page after this page is brought into memory the  process continues to execute faulting as necessary until every page that it  needs is in memory at that it can execute with no more faults this  scheme is never bring a page into memory until it is  required  theoretically some programs could access several new pages of memory  with each instruction execution one page for the instruction and many for  data possibly causing multiple page faults per instruction this situation  would result in unacceptable system performance fortunately analysis of  running processes shows that this behavior is exceedingly unlikely programs  tend to have described in section  which results in  reasonable performance from demand paging  the hardware to support demand paging is the same as the hardware for  paging and swapping  page table this table has the ability to mark an entry invalid through a  valid invalid bit or a special value of protection bits  secondary memory this memory holds those pages that are not present  in main memory the secondary memory is usually a high speed disk it is  known as the swap device and the section of disk used for this purpose is  known as swap space allocation is discussed in chapter  a crucial requirement for demand paging is the ability to restart any  instruction after a page fault because we save the state registers condition  code instruction counter of the interrupted process when the page fault  occurs we must be able to restart the process in exactly the same place and  state except that the desired page is now in memory and is accessible in most  cases this requirement is easy to meet a page fault may occur at any memory  reference if the page fault occurs on the instruction fetch we can restart by  fetching the instruction again if a page fault occurs while we are fetching an  operand we must fetch and decode the instruction again and then fetch the  operand  as a worst case example consider a three address instruction such as add  the content of a to b placing the result in c these are the steps to execute this  instruction  fetch and decode the instruction add  fetch a  fetch b  add a and b  store the sum in c  if we fault when we try to store inc because c is in a page not currently  in memory we will have to get the desired page bring it in correct the  page table and restart the instruction the restart will require fetching the  instruction again decoding it again fetching the two operands again and    then adding again however there is not much repeated work less than one  complete instruction and the repetition is necessary only when a page fault  occurs  the major difficulty arises when one instruction may modify several  different locations for example consider the ibm system mvc move  character instruction which can ncove up to bytes from one location to  another possibly overlapping location if either block source or destination  straddles a page boundary a page fault might occur after the move is partially  done in addition if the source and destination blocks overlap the source  block may have been modified in which case we cannot simply restart the  instruction  this problem can be solved in two different ways in one solution the  microcode computes and attempts to access both ends of both blocks if a page  fault is going to occm it will happen at this step before anything is modified  the move can then take place we know that no page fault can occur since all  the relevant pages are in memory the other solution uses temporary registers  to hold the values of overwritten locations if there is a page fault all the old  values are written back into memory before the trap occurs this action restores  memory to its state before the instruction was started so that the instruction  can be repeated  this is by no means the only architectural problem resulting from adding  paging to an existing architecture to allow demand paging but it illustrates  some of the difficulties involved paging is added between the cpu and the  memory in a computer system it should be entirely transparent to the user  process thus people often assume that paging can be added to any system  although this assumption is true for a non demand paging environment  where a page fault represents a fatal errm it is not true where a page fault  means only that an additional page must be brought into memory and the  process restarted   performance of demand paging  demand paging can significantly affect the performance of a computer system  to see why let s compute the effective access time for a demand paged  memory for most computer systems the memory access time denoted ma  ranges from to nanoseconds as long as we have no page faults the  effective access time is equal to the memory access time if however a page  fault occurs we must first read the relevant page from disk and then access the  desired word  let p be the probability of a page fault  p   we would expect p to  be close to zero that is we would expect to have only a few page faults the   t tp r ·nrr access is then  effective access time  p x ma p x page fault time  to compute the effective access time we must know how much time is  needed to service a page fault a page fault causes the following sequence to  occur  trap to the operating system  save the user registers and process state   chapter  deterncine that the interrupt was a page fault  check that the page reference was legal and determine the location of the  page on the disk  issue a read from the disk to a free frame  a wait in a queue for this device until the read request is serviced  b wait for the device seek and or latency time  c begin the transfer of the page to a free frame  while waiting allocate the cpu to some other user cpu scheduling  optional  receive an interrupt from the disk i subsystem i completed  save the registers and process state for the other user if step is executed  determine that the interrupt was from the disk  correct the page table and other tables to show that the desired page is  now in memory  wait for the cpu to be allocated to this process again  restore the user registers process state and new page table and then  resume the interrupted instruction  not all of these steps are necessary in every case for example we are assuming  that in step the cpu is allocated to another process while the i o occurs  this arrangement allows multiprogramming to maintain cpu utilization but  requires additional time to resume the page fault service routine when the i  transfer is complete  in any case we are faced with tlu·ee major components of the page fault  service time  service the page fault interrupt  read in the page  restart the process  the first and third tasks can be reduced with careful coding to several  hundred instructions these tasks may take from to microseconds each  the page switch time however will probably be close to milliseconds   a typical hard disk has an average latency of milliseconds a seek of   milliseconds and a transfer time of milliseconds thus the total  paging time is about milliseconds including hardware and software time  remember also that we are looking at only the device service time if a queue  of processes is waiting for the device we have to add device queueing time as  we wait for the paging device to be free to service our request increasing even  more the time to swap  with an average page fault service time of milliseconds and a memory\\xad access time of nanoseconds the effective access time in nanoseconds is    effective access time  p x  p milliseconds   p x p x    x p  we see then that the effective access time is directly proportional to the  if one access out of causes a page fault the effective  access time is microseconds the computer will be slowed down by a factor  of because of demand paging if we want performance degradation to be  less than percent we need     x p    x p  p   that is to keep the slowdown due to paging at a reasonable level we can  allow fewer than one memory access out of to page fault in sum  it is important to keep the page fault rate low in a demand paging system  otherwise the effective access time increases slowing process execution  dramatically  an additional aspect of demand paging is the handling and overall use  of swap space disk i to swap space is generally faster than that to the file  system it is faster because swap space is allocated in much larger blocks and  file lookups and indirect allocation methods are not used chapter the  system can therefore gain better paging throughput by copying an entire file  image into the swap space at process startup and then performing demand  paging from the swap space another option is to demand pages from the file  system initially but to write the pages to swap space as they are replaced this  approach will ensure that only needed pages are read from the file system but  that all subsequent paging is done from swap space  some systems attempt to limit the amount of swap space used through  demand paging of binary files demand pages for such files are brought directly  from the file system however when page replacement is called for these  frames can simply be overwritten because they are never modified and the  pages can be read in from the file system again if needed using this approach  the file system itself serves as the backing store however swap space must  still be used for pages not associated with a file these pages include the stack  and heap for a process this method appears to be a good compromise and is  used in several systems including solaris and bsd unix  in section  we illustrated how a process can start quickly by merely demand\\xad paging in the page containing the first instruction however process creation  using the fork system call may initially bypass the need for demand paging  by using a technique similar to page sharing covered in section  this  technique provides for rapid process creation and minimizes the number of  new pages that must be allocated to the newly created process   chapter  physical  figure before process i modifies page c  recall thatthe fork system call creates a child process that is a duplicate  of its parent traditionally fork worked by creating a copy of the parent s  address space for the child duplicating the pages belonging to the parent  however considering that many child processes invoke the exec system  call immediately after creation the copying of the parent s address space may  be unnecessary instead we can use a technique known as  which works by allowing the parent and child processes initially to share the  same pages these shared pages are marked as copy on write pages meaning  that if either process writes to a shared page a copy of the shared page is  created copy on write is illustrated in figures and figure which show  the contents of the physical memory before and after process modifies page  c  for example assume that the child process attempts to modify a page  containing portions of the stack with the pages set to be copy on write the  operating system will create a copy of this page nl apping it to the address space  of the child process the child process will then modify its copied page and not  the page belonging to the parent process obviously when the copy on write  technique is used only the pages that are modified by either process are copied  all unmodified pages can be shared by the parent and child processes note too  process physical  memory  figure after process modifies page c process     that only pages that can be nwdified need be m arked as copy on write pages  that cannot be modified pages containing executable code can be shared by  the parent and child copy on write is a common technique used by several  operating systems including windows xp linux and solaris  when it is determined that a page is going to be duplicated using copy\\xad on write it is important to note the location from which the free page will  be allocated many operating systems provide a of free pages for such  requests these free pages are typically allocated when the stack or heap for a  process must expand or when there are copy on write pages to be managed  operating systems typically allocate these pages using a technique known as  zem fhl on den and zero fill on demand pages have been zeroed out before  being allocated thus erasing the previous contents  several versions of unix including solaris and linux provide a variation  ofthe fork system call vfork for fori that operates  differently from fork with copy on write with vfork the parent process  is suspended and the child process uses the address space of the parent  because vfork does not use copy on write if the child process changes  any pages of the parent s address space the altered pages will be visible to the  parent once it resumes therefore vf ork must be used with caution to ensure  that the child process does not modify the address space of the parent vf or k  is intended to be used when the child process calls exec immediately after  creation because no copying of pages takes place vf ork is an extremely  efficient method of process creation and is sometimes used to implement unix  command line shell interfaces  in our earlier discussion of the page fault rate we assumed that each page  faults at most once when it is first referenced this representation is not strictly  accurate however if a process of ten pages actually uses only half of them then  demand paging saves the i necessary to load the five pages that are never  used we could also increase our degree of multiprogramming by running  twice as many processes thus if we had forty frames we could run eight  processes rather than the four that could run if each required ten frames five  of which were never used  if we increase our degree of multiprogramming we are  memory if we run six processes each of which is ten pages in size but  uses only five pages we have higher cpu utilization and throughput  ten frames to spare it is possible however that each of these processes for a  particular data set may suddenly try to use all ten of its pages resulting in a  need for sixty frames when only forty are available  further consider that system memory is not used only for holding program  pages buffers for i also consume a considerable amount of memory this use  can increase the strain on memory placement algorithms deciding how much  memory to allocate to i and how much to program pages is a significant  challenge some systems allocate a fixed percentage of memory for i buffers  whereas others allow both user processes and the i subsystem to compete  for all system memory   chapter  valid invalid  pc     came f il  logical memory  for user page table  for user  valid invalid    frame bi  r  v  v         logical memory  for user page table  for user monitor         j   a   e  physical  memory  figure need for page replacement  over allocation of memory manifests itself as follows while a user process  is executing a page fault occurs the operating system determines where the  desired page is residing on the disk but then finds that there are no free frames  on the free frame list all memory is in use figure   the operating system has several options at this point it could terminate  the user process however demand paging is the operating system s attempt to  improve the computer system s utilization and throughput users should not  be aware that their processes are running on a paged system paging should  be logically transparent to the user so this option is not the best choice  the operating system could instead swap out a process freeing all its  frames and reducing the level of multiprogramming this option is a good one  in certain circumstances and we consider it further in section here we  discuss the most common solution   basic page replacement  page replacement takes the following approach if no frame is free we find  one that is not currently being used and free it we can free a frame by writing  its contents to swap space and changing the page table and all other tables to  indicate that the page is no longer in memory figure  we can now use  the freed frame to hold the page for which the process faulted we modify the  page fault service routine to include page replacement  find the location of the desired page on the disk  find a free frame  a if there is a free frame use it    b if there is no free frame use a page replacement algorithnc to select  a  c write the victim frame to the disk change the page and frame tables  accordingly  read the desired page into the newly freed frame change the page and  frame tables  restart the user process  notice that if no frames are free two page transfers one out and one in are  required this situation effectively doubles the page fault service time and  increases the effective access time accordingly  we can reduce this overhead by using a or when this  scheme is used each page or frame has a modify bit associated with it in the  hardware the modify bit for a page is set by the hardware whenever any word  or byte in the page is written into indicating that the page has been modified  when we select a page for replacement we examine its modify bit if the bit  is set we know that the page has been modified since it was read in from the  disk in this case we must write the page to the disk if the modify bit is not set  however the page has not been modified since it was read into memory in this  case we need not write the memory page to the disk it is already there this  technique also applies to read only pages for example pages of binary code  such pages cannot be modified thus they may be discarded when desired  this scheme can significantly reduce the time required to service a page fault  since it reduces i o time by one half if the page has not been modified  frame valid invalid bit     physical  memory  figure page replacement   chapter  page replacement is basic to demand paging it completes the separation  between logical memory and physical memory with this mechanism an  enormous virtual memory can be provided for programn lers on a smaller  physical memory with no demand paging user addresses are mapped into  physical addresses so the two sets of addresses can be different all the pages of  a process still must be in physical memory however with demand paging the  size of the logical address space is no longer constrained by physical memory  if we have a user process of twenty pages we can execute it in ten frames  simply by using demand paging and using a replacement algorithm to find  a free frame whenever necessary if a page that has been modified is to be  replaced its contents are copied to the disk a later reference to that page will  cause a page fault at that time the page will be brought back into memory  perhaps replacing some other page in the process  we must solve two major problems to implement demand  develop a algorithm and a     l tceme lu f   h  that is if we have multiple processes in memory we must decide how many  frames to allocate to each process and when page replacement is required  we must select the frames that are to be replaced designing appropriate  algorithms to solve these problems is an important task because disk i  is so expensive even slight improvements in demand paging methods yield  large gains in system performance  there are many different page replacement algorithms every operating  system probably has its own replacement scheme how do we select a  particular replacement algorithm in general we want the one with the lowest  page fault rate  we evaluate an algorithm by running it on a particular string of memory  references and computing the number of page faults the string of memory  references is called a reference we can generate reference strings  artificially by using a random number generator for example or we can trace  a given system and record the address of each memory reference the latter  choice produces a large number of data on the order of million addresses  per second to reduce the number of data we use two facts  first for a given page size and the page size is generally fixed by the  hardware or system we need to consider only the page number rather than  the entire address second if we have a reference to a page p then any references  to page p that immediately follow will never cause a page fault page p will be in  memory after the first reference so the immediately following references will  not fault  for example if we trace a particular process we might record the following  address sequence          at bytes per page this sequence is reduced to the following reference  string             g   j    q  ol co      q   e   j c       number of frames  figure i graph of page faults versus number of frames  to determine the number of page faults for a particular reference string and  page replacement algorithm we also need to know the number of page frames  available obviously as the number of frames available increases the number  of page faults decreases for the reference stril lg considered previously for  example if we had three or more frames we would have only three faults\\xad one fault for the first reference to each page in contrast with only one frame  available we would have a replacement with every reference resulting in  eleven faults in general we expect a curve such as that in figure as the  number of frames increases the number of page faults drops to some minimal  level of course adding physical memory increases the number of frames  we next illustrate several page replacement algorithms in doing so we  use the reference string  for a memory with three frames   fifo page replacement  the simplest page replacement algorithm is a first in first out fifo algorithm  a fifo replacement algorithm associates with each page the time when that  page was brought into memory when a page must be replaced the oldest  page is chosen notice that it is not strictly necessary to record the time when  a page is brought in we can create a fifo queue to hold all pages in memory  we replace the page at the head of the queue when a page is brought into  memory we insert it at the tail of the queue  for our example reference string our three frames are initially empty the  first three references  cause page faults and are brought into these empty  frames the next reference replaces page because page was brought in  first since is the next reference and is already in memory we have no fault  for this reference the first reference to results in replacement of page since   chapter  reference string       page frames  figure fifo page replacement algorithm  it is now first in line because of this replacement the next reference to will  fault page is then replaced by page this process continues as shown in  figure every time a fault occurs we show which pages are in our three  frames there are fifteen faults altogether  the fifo page replacement algorithm is easy to lmderstand and program  however its performance is not always good on the one hand the page  replaced may be an initialization module that was used a long time ago and is  no longer needed on the other hand it could contain a heavily used variable  that was initialized early and is in constant use  notice that even if we select for replacement a page that is in active use  everything still works correctly after we replace an active page with a new  one a fault occurs almost immediately to retrieve the active page some other  page must be replaced to bring the active page back into memory thus a bad  replacement choice increases the page fault rate and slows process execution  it does not however cause incorrect execution  to illustrate the problems that are possible with a fifo page replacement  algorithm we consider the following reference string         figure shows the curve of page faults for this reference string versus the  number of available frames notice that the number of faults for four frames   ten is greater than the number of faults for three frames nine this most  unexpected result is known as for some page replacement  algorithms the page fault rate may increase as the number of allocated frames  increases we would expect that giving more memory to a process would  improve its performance in some early research investigators noticed that  this assumption was not always true belady s anomaly was discovered as a  result   optimal page replacement  of belady s anomaly was the search for an  which has the lowest page fault rate of all  algorithms and will never suffer from belady s anomaly such an algorithm  does exist and has been called opt or min it is simply this  replace the page that will not be used  for the longest period of time           cj  oj m      cj o e   c    number of frames  figure page fault curve for fifo replacement on a reference string  use of this page replacement algorithm guarantees the lowest possible page\\xad fault rate for a fixed number of frames  for example on our sample reference string the optimal page replacement  algorithm would yield nine page faults as shown in figure the first three  references cause faults that fill the three empty frames the reference to page   replaces page because page will not be used until reference whereas  page will be used at and page at the reference to page replaces  page as page will be the last of the three pages in memory to be referenced  again with only nine page faults optimal replacement is much better than  a fifo algorithm which results in fifteen faults if we ignore the first three  which all algorithms must suffer then optimal replacement is twice as good as  fifo replacement irt fact no replacement algorithm can process this reference  string in three frames with fewer than nine faults  unfortunately the optimal page replacement algorithm is difficult to  implement because it requires future knowledge of the reference string we  encountered a similar situation with the sjf cpu schedulin g algorithm in  section  as a result the optimal algorithm is used mainly for comparison  studies for instance it may be useful to know that although a new algorithm  reference string       page frames  figure optimal page replacement algorithm   chapter  is not optimat it is within percent of optimal at worst and within  percent on average   lru page replacement  lf the optimal algorithm is not feasible perhaps an approximation of the  optimal algorithm is possible the key distinction between the fifo and opt  algorithms other than looking backward versus forward in time is that the  fifo algorithm uses the time when a page was brought into memory whereas  the opt algorithm uses the time when a page is to be used if we use the  recent past as an approximation of the near future then we can replace the  that has not been used for the longest period of time this approach is the  lru replacement associates with each page the time of that page s last use  when a page must be replaced lru chooses the page that has not been used  for the longest period of time we can think of this strategy as the optimal  page replacement algorithm looking backward in time rather than forward   strangely if we let sr be the reverse of a reference strings then the page fault  rate for the opt algorithm on sis the same as the page fault rate for the opt  algorithm on sr similarly the page fault rate for the lru algorithm on sis the  same as the page fault rate for the lru algorithm on sr  the result of applying lru replacement to our example reference string is  shown in figure the lru algorithm produces twelve faults notice that  the first five faults are the same as those for optimal replacement when the  reference to page occurs however lru replacement sees that of the three  frames in memory page was used least recently thus the lru algorithm  replaces page not knowing that page is about to be used when it then faults  for page the lru algorithm replaces page since it is now the least recently  used of the three pages in memory despite these problems lru replacement  with twelve faults is much better than fifo replacement with fifteen  the lru policy is often used as a page replacement algorithm and  is considered to be good the major problem is how to implement lru  replacement an lru page replacement algorithm may require substantial  hardware assistance the problem is to determine an order for the frames  defined by the time of last use two implementations are feasible  counters in the simplest case we associate with each page table entry a  time of use field and add to the cpu a logical clock or counter the clock is  reference string       page frames  figure lru page replacement algorithm    incremented for every memory reference whenever a reference to a page  is made the contents of the clock register are copied to the tine of use  field in the page table entry for that page in this way we always have  the time of the last reference to each page we replace the page with the  smallest time value this scheme requires a search of the page table to find  the lru page and a write to memory to the time of use field in the page  table for each memory access the times must also be m aintained when  page tables are changed due to cpu scheduling overflow of the clock  must be considered  stack another approach to implementing lru replacement is to keep  a stack of page numbers whenever a page is referenced it is removed  from the stack and put on the top in this way the most recently used  page is always at the top of the stack and the least recently used page is  always at the bottom figure  because entries must be removed from  the middle of the stack it is best to implement this approach by using a  doubly linked list with a head pointer and a tail pointer removing a page  and putting it on the top of the stack then requires changing six pointers  at worst each update is a little more expensive but there is no search for  a replacement the tail pointer points to the bottom of the stack which is  the lru page this approach is particularly appropriate for software or  microcode implementations of lru replacement  like optimal replacement lru replacement does not suffer from belady s  both belong to a class of page replacement algorithms called si ack  that can never exhibit belady s anomaly a stack algorithm is  an algorithm for which it can be shown that the set of pages in memory for n  frames is always a subset of the set of pages that would be in memory with n  frames for lru replacement the set of pages in memory would be the n most  recently referenced pages if the number of frames is increased these n pages  will still be the most recently referenced and so will still be in memory  note that neither implementation of lru would be conceivable without  hardware assistance beyond the standard tlb registers the updating of the  reference string    stack  before  a  stack  after  b  i l  a b  figure use of a stack to record the most recent page references   chapter  clock fields or stack must be done for every memory reference if we were to  use an interrupt for every reference to allow software to update such data  structures it would slow every memory reference by a factor of at least ten  hence slowing every user process by a factor of ten few systems could tolerate  that level of overhead for memory management   lru approximation page replacement  few computer systems provide sufficient hardware support for true lru page  replacement some systems provide no hardware support and other page\\xad replacement algorithms such as a fifo algorithm must be used many systems  provide some help however in the form of a the reference bit  for a page is set by the hardware whenever that page is referenced either a  read or a write to any byte in the page reference bits are associated with each  entry in the page table  initially all bits are cleared to by the operating system as a user process  executes the bit associated with each page referenced is set to by the  hardware after some time we can determine which pages have been used and  which have not been used by examining the reference bits although we do not  know the order of use this information is the basis for many page replacement  algorithms that approximate lru replacement   additional reference bits algorithm  we can gain additional ordering information by recording the reference bits at  regular intervals we can keep an bit byte for each page in a table in memory  at regular intervals say every milliseconds a timer interrupt transfers  control to the operating system the operating system shifts the reference bit  for each page into the high order bit of its bit byte shifting the other bits right  by bit and discarding the low order bit these bit shift registers contain the  history of page use for the last eight time periods if the shift register contains   for example then the page has not been used for eight time periods  a page that is used at least once in each period has a shift register value of   a page with a history register value of has been used more  recently than one with a value of if we interpret these bit bytes  as unsigned integers the page with the lowest number is the lru page and  it can be replaced notice that the numbers are not guaranteed to be unique  however we can either replace swap out all pages with the smallest value or  use the fifo method to choose among them  the number of bits of history included in the shift register can be varied  of course and is selected depending on the hardware available to make  the updating as fast as possible in the extreme case the number can be  reduced to zero leaving only the reference bit itself this algorithm is called  the   second chance algorithm  the basic algorithm of second chance replacement is a fifo replacement  algorithm when a page has been selected however we inspect its reference  bit if the value is we proceed to replace this page but if the reference bit  is set to we give the page a second chance and move on to select the next  next  victim  reference pages reference pages  bits bits  circular queue of pages circular queue of pages   a b  figure second chance clock page replacement algorithm  fifo page when a page gets a second chance its reference bit is cleared and  its arrival time is reset to the current time thus a page that is given a second  chance will not be replaced until all other pages have been replaced or given  second chances in addition if a page is used often enough to keep its reference  bit set it will never be replaced  one way to implement the second chance algorithm sometimes referred  to as the clock algorithm is as a circular queue a poiter that is a hand on  the clock indicates which page is to be replaced next when a frame is needed  the pointer advances until it finds a page with a reference bit as it advances  it clears the reference bits figure  once a victim page is found the page  is replaced and the new page is inserted in the circular queue in that position  notice that in the worst case when all bits are set the pointer cycles through  the whole queue giving each page a second chance it clears all the reference  bits before selecting the next page for replacement second chance replacement  degenerates to fifo replacement if all bits are set   enhanced second chance algorithm  we can enhance the second chance algorithm by considering the reference bit  and the modify bit described in section  as an ordered pair with these  two bits we have the following four possible classes    neither recently used nor modified best page to replace   chapter    not recently used hut modified not quite as good because the  page will need to be written out before replacement    recently used but clean probably will be used again soon    recently used and modified probably will be used again soon and  the page will be need to be written out to disk before it can be replaced  each page is in one of these four classes when page replacement is called for  we use the same scheme as in the clock algorithm but instead of examining  whether the page to which we are pointing has the reference bit set to  we examine the class to which that page belongs we replace the first page  encountered in the lowest nonempty class notice that we may have to scan  the circular queue several times before we find a page to be replaced  the major difference between this algorithm and the simpler clock algo\\xad rithm is that here we give preference to those pages that have been modified  to reduce the number of i os required   counting based page replacement  there are many other algorithms that can be used for page replacement for  example we can keep a counter of the number of references that have been  made to each page and develop the following two schemes  the least frequently used lfu page replacement algorithm requires  that the page with the smallest count be replaced the reason for this  selection is that an actively used page should have a large reference count  a problem arises however when a page is used heavily during the initial  phase of a process but then is never used again since it was used heavily  it has a large count and remains in memory even though it is no longer  needed one solution is to shift the counts right by bit at regular intervals  forming an exponentially decaying average usage count  the most frequently used mfu page replacement algorithm is based  on the argument that the page with the smallest count was probably just  brought in and has yet to be used  as you might expect neither mfu nor lfu replacement is common the  implementation of these algorithms is expensive and they do not approxin late  opt replacement well   page buffering algorithms  other procedures are often used in addition to a specific page replacement  algorithm for example systems commonly keep a pool of free frames when  a page fault occurs a victim frame is chosen as before however the desired  page is read into a free frame from the pool before the victim is written out this  procedure allows the process to restart as soon as possible without waiting  for the victim page to be written out when the victim is later written out its  frame is added to the free frame pool    an expansion of this idea is to maintain a list of modified pages whenever  the paging device is idle a modified page is selected and is written to the disk  its modify bit is then reset this scheme increases the probability that a page  will be clean when it is selected for replacement and will not need to be written  out  another modification is to keep a pool of free frames but to remember  which page was in each frame since the frame contents are not modified when  a frame is written to the disk the old page can be reused directly fronc the  free frame pool if it is needed before that frame is reused no i o is needed in  this case when a page fault occurs we first check whether the desired page is  in the free frame pool if it is not we must select a free frame and read into it  this technique is used in the vax vms system along with a fifo replace\\xad ment algorithm when the fifo replacement algorithm mistakenly replaces a  page that is still in active use that page is quickly retrieved from the free frame  pool and no i o is necessary the free frame buffer provides protection against  the relatively poor but sirnple fifo replacement algorithm this method is  necessary because the early versions of vax did not implement the reference  bit correctly  some versions of the unix system use this method in conjunction with  the second chance algorithm it can be a useful augmentation to any page\\xad replacement algorithm to reduce the penalty incurred if the wrong victim  page is selected   applications and page replacement  in certain cases applications accessing data through the operating system s  virtual memory perform worse than if the operating system provided no  buffering at all a typical example is a database which provides its own  memory management and i buffering applications like this understand  their memory use and disk use better than does an operating system that is  implementing algorithms for general purpose use if the operating system is  buffering i and the application is doing so as well then twice the memory  is being used for a set of i  in another example data warehouses frequently perform massive sequen\\xad tial disk reads followed by computations and writes the lru algorithm would  be removing old pages and preserving new ones while the application would  more likely be reading older pages than newer ones as it starts its sequential  reads again here mfu would actually be more efficient than lru  because of such problems some operating systems give special programs  the ability to use a disk partition as a large sequential array of logical blocks  without any file system data structures this array is sometimes called the raw  disk and i o to this array is termed raw i raw i bypasses all the file\\xad system services such as file i demand paging file locking prefetching space  allocation file names and directories note that although certain applications  are more efficient when implementing their own special purpose storage  services on a raw partition most applications perform better when they use  the regular file system services   chapter    we turn next to the issue of allocation how do we allocate the fixed amount  of free memory among the various processes if we have free frames and  two processes how many frames does each process get  the simplest case is the single user system consider a single user system  with kb of memory composed of pages kb in size this system has  frames the operating system may take kb leaving frames for the user  process under pure demand paging all frames would initially be put on  the free frame list when a user process started execution it would generate a  sequence of page faults the first page faults would all get free frames from  the free frame list when the free frame list was exhausted a page replacement  algorithm would be used to select one of the in memory pages to be replaced  with the th and so on when the process terminated the frames would  once again be placed on the free frame list  there are many variations on this simple strategy we can require that the  operating system allocate all its buffer and table space from the free frame list  when this space is not in use by the operating system it can be used to support  user paging we can try to keep three free frames reserved on the free frame list  at all times thus when a page fault occurs there is a free frame available to  page into while the page swap is taking place a replacement can be selected  which is then written to the disk as the user process continues to execute  other variants are also possible but the basic strategy is clear the user process  is allocated any free frame   minimum number of frames  our strategies for the allocation of frames are constrained in various ways we  cannot for example allocate more than the total number of available frames   unless there is page sharing we must also allocate at least a minimum number  of frames here we look more closely at the latter requirement  one reason for allocating at least a minimum number of frames involves  performance obviously as the number of frames allocated to each process  decreases the page fault rate increases slowing process execution in addition  remember that when a page fault occurs before an executing ilcstruction  is complete the instruction must be restarted consequently we must have  enough frames to hold all the different pages that any single ilcstruction can  reference  for example consider a machine in which all memory reference instruc\\xad tions may reference only one memory address in this case we need at least one  frame for the instruction and one frame for the mernory reference in addition  if one level indirect addressing is allowed for example a load instruction on  page can refer to an address on page which is an indirect reference to page   then paging requires at least three frames per process think about what  might happen if a process had only two frames  the minimum number of frames is defined by the computer architecture  for example the move instruction for the pdp includes more than one word  for some addressing modes and thus the ilcstruction itself may straddle two  pages in addition each of its two operands may be indirect references for a  total of six frames another example is the ibm mvc instruction since the    instruction is from storage location to storage location it takes bytes and can  straddle two pages the block of characters to move and the area to which it  is to be m oved can each also straddle two pages this situation would require  six frames the worst case occurs when the mvc instruction is the operand of  an execute instruction that straddles a page boundary in this case we need  eight frames  the worst case scenario occurs in computer architectures that allow  multiple levels of indirection for example each bit word could contain  a bit address plus a bit indirect indicator theoretically a simple load  instruction could reference an indirect address that could reference an indirect  address on another page that could also reference an indirect address on yet  another page and so on until every page in virtual memory had been touched  thus in the worst case the entire virtual memory must be in physical memory  to overcome this difficulty we must place a limit on the levels of indirection for  example limit an instruction to at most levels of indirection when the first  indirection occurs a counter is set to the counter is then decremented for  each successive irtdirection for this instruction if the counter is decremented to   a trap occurs excessive indirection this limitation reduces the maximum  number of memory references per instruction to requiring the same number  of frames  whereas the minimum number of frames per process is defined by the  architecture the maximum number is defined by the amount of available  physical memory in between we are still left with significant choice in frame  allocation   allocation algorithms  the easiest way to split m frames among n processes is to give everyone an  equal share m n frames for instance if there are frames and five processes  each process will get frames the three leftover frames can be used as a  free frame buffer pool this scheme is called  an alternative is to recognize that various processes will need differing  amounts of memory consider a system with a kb frame size if a small  student process of kb and an interactive database of kb are the only  two processes running in a system with free frames it does not make much  sense to give each process frames the student process does not need more  than frames so the other are strictly speaking wasted  to solve this problem we can use in which we  allocate available memory to each process according to its size let the size of  the virtual memory for process p be s and define  s ls  then if the total number of available frames is m we allocate a frames to  process p where a is approximately  a s s x m   chapter  of course we must adjust each ai to be an integer that is greater than the  ncinimum number of frames required by tle instruction set with a sum not  exceeding m  with proportional allocation we would split frames between two  processes one of pages and one of pages by allocating frames and  frames respectively since   x  and   x   in this way both processes share the available frames according to their   needs rather than equally  in both equal and proportional allocation of course the allocation may  vary according to the multiprogramming level if the multiprogramming level  is increased each process will lose some frames to provide the memory needed  for the new process conversely if the multiprogramming level decreases the  frames that were allocated to the departed process can be spread over the  remaining processes  notice that with either equal or proportional allocation a high priority  process is treated the same as a low priority process by its definition however  we may want to give the high priority process more memory to speed its  execution to the detriment of low priority processes one solution is to use  a proportional allocation scheme wherein the ratio of frames depends not on  the relative sizes of processes but rather on the priorities of processes or on a  combination of size and priority   global versus local allocation  another important factor in the way frames are allocated to the various  processes is page replacement with multiple processes competing for frames  we can classify page replacement algorithms into two broad categories  and local global replacement allows a process to  a replacement frame from the set of all frames even if that frame is  currently allocated to some other process that is one process can take a frame  from another local replacement requires that each process select from only its  own set of allocated frames  for example consider an allocation scheme wherein we allow high priority  processes to select frames from low priority processes for replacement a  process can select a replacement from among its own frames or the frames  of any lower priority process this approach allows a high priority process to  increase its frame allocation at the expense of a low priority process with a  local replacement strategy the number of frames allocated to a process does not  change with global replacement a process may happen to select only frames  allocated to other processes thus increasing the number of frames allocated to  it assuming that other processes do not choose its frames for replacement  one problem with a global replacement algorithm is that a process cannot  control its own page fault rate the set of pages in memory for a process  depends not only on the paging behavior of that process but also on the paging  behavior of other processes therefore the same process may perform quite    differently for example taking seconds for one execution and seconds  for the next execution because of totally external circuntstances such is not  the case with a local replacement algorithm under local replacement the  set of pages in memory for a process is affected by the paging behavior of  only that process local replacement might hinder a process however by  not making available to it other less used pages of memory thus global  replacement generally results in greater system throughput and is therefore  the more common method   non uniform memory access  thus far in our coverage of virtual memory we have assumed that all main  memory is created equal or at least that it is accessed equally on many  computer systems that is not the case often in systems with multiple cpus   section  a given cpu can access some sections of main memory faster  than it can access others these performance differences are caused by how  cpus and memory are interconnected in the system frequently such a system  is made up of several system boards each containing multiple cpus and some  memory the system boards are interconnected in various ways ranging from  system busses to high speed network connections like infiniband as you  might expect the cpus on a particular board can access the memory on that  board with less delay than they can access memory on other boards in the  system systems in which memory access times vary significantly are known  collectively as systems and without  exception they are slower than systems in which memory and cpus are located  on the same motherboard  managing which page frames are stored at which locations can significantly  affect performance in numa systems if we treat memory as uniform in such  a system cpus may wait significantly longer for memory access than if we  modify memory allocation algorithms to take numa into account similar  changes must be rnade to the scheduling system the goal of these changes is  to have memory frames allocated as close as possible to the cpu on which  the process is running the definition of close is with minimum latency  which typically means on the same system board as the cpu  the algorithmic changes consist of having the scheduler track the last cpu  on which each process ran if the scheduler tries to schedule each process onto  its previous cpu and the memory management system tries to allocate frames  for the process close to the cpu on which it is being scheduled then improved  cache hits and decreased memory access times will result  the picture is more complicated once threads are added for example a  process with many running threads may end up with those threads scheduled  on many different system boards how is the memory to be allocated in this  case solaris solves the problem by creating an entity in the kernel each  lgroup gathers together close cpus and memory in fact there is a hierarchy  of lgroups based on the amount of latency between the groups solaris tries to  schedule all threads of a process and allocate all memory of a process within  an lgroup if that is not possible it picks nearby lgroups for the rest of the  resources needed in this manner overall memory latency is minimized and  cpu cache hit rates are maximized   chapter    if the number of frames allocated to a low priority process falls below the  minimum number required by the computer architecture we must suspend  that process s execution we should then page out its remaining pages freeing  all its allocated frames this provision introduces a swap in swap out level of  intermediate cpu scheduling  in fact look at any process that does not have enough frames if the  process does not have the num ber of frames it needs to support pages in  active use it will quickly page fault at this point it must replace some page  however since all its pages are in active use it must replace a page that will  be needed again right away consequently it quickly faults again and again  and again replacing pages that it must back in immediately  this high paging activity is called a process is thrashing if it is  spending more time paging than executing   cause of thrashing  thrashing results in severe performance problems consider the following  scenario which is based on the actual behavior of early paging systems  the operating system monitors cpu utilization if cpu utilization is too low  we increase the degree of multiprogramming by introducing a new process  to the system a global page replacement algorithm is used it replaces pages  without regard to the process to which they belong now suppose that a process  enters a new phase in its execution and needs more frames it starts faulting and  taking frames away from other processes these processes need those pages  however and so they also fault taking frames from other processes these  faulting processes must use the pagin g device to swap pages in and out as  they queue up for the paging device the ready queue empties as processes  wait for the paging device cpu utilization decreases  the cpu scheduler sees the decreasing cpu utilization and increases the  degree of multiprogramming as a result the new process tries to get started  by taking frames from running processes causing more page faults and a longer  queue for the paging device as a result cpu utilization drops even further  and the cpu scheduler tries to increase the degree of multiprogramming even  more thrashing has occurred and system throughput plunges the page\\xad fault rate increases tremendously as a result the effective m emory access  time increases no work is getting done because the processes are spending  all their time paging  this phenomenon is illustrated in figure in which cpu utilization  is plotted against the degree of multiprogramming as the degree of multi\\xad programming increases cpu utilization also ilccreases although more slowly  until a maximum is reached if the degree of multiprogramming is increased  even further thrashing sets in and cpu utilization drops sharply at this point  to increase cpu utilization and stop thrashing we must decrease the degree of  multiprogramming  we can limit the effects of thrashing by using a   or with local replacement if one process  starts thrashing it cannot frames from another process and cause the latter  to thrash as well however the problem is not entirely solved if processes are    degree of multiprogramming  figure thrashing  thrashing they will be in the queue for the paging device most of the time the  average service time for a page fault will increase because of the longer average  queue for the paging device thus the effective access time will increase even  for a process that is not thrashing  to prevent thtashing we must provide a process with as many frames as  it needs but how do we know how many frames it needs there are several  teclmiques the working set strategy section  starts by looking at how  frames a process is actually using this approach defines the locality  of process execution  the locality model states that as a process executes it moves from locality  to locality a locality is a set of pages that are actively used together figure   a program is generally composed of several different localities which  may overlap  for example when a function is called it defines a new locality in this  locality memory references are made to the instructions of the function call its  local variables and a subset of the global variables when we exit the function  the process leaves this locality since the local variables and instructions of the  function are no longer in active use we may return to this locality later  thus we see that localities are defined by the program structure and its  data structures the locality model states that all programs will exhibit this  basic memory reference structure note that the locality model is the unstated  principle behind the caching discussions so far in this book if accesses to any  types of data were random rather than patterned caching would be useless  suppose we allocate enough frames to a process to accommodate its current  locality it will fault for the pages in its locality until all these pages are in  memory then it will not fault again until it changes localities if we do not  allocate enough frames to accommodate the size of the current locality the  process will thrash since it cannot keep in memory all the pages that it is  actively using   working set model  as mentioned the is based on the assumption of locality  this model uses a parameter  to define the vrindovv the idea   chapter      wh     jjl jlli     j   j        lj i c  i  i e   lj  e  execution time    figure locality in a memory reference pattern  is to examine the most recent references the set of pages in the most  recent page references is the figure  if a page is in active  use it will be in the working set if it is no longer being used it will drop from  the working set time units after its last reference thus the working set is an  approximation of the program s locality  for example given the sequence of memory references shown in figure   if  memory references then the working set at time t is     by time t the working set has changed to   the accuracy of the working set depends on the selection of if is too  small it will not encompass the entire locality if is too large it may overlap    page reference table                r r  t  ws t    figure working set model  several localities in the extrem e if l is infinite the working set is the set of  pages touched during the process execution  the most important property of the working set then is its size if we  compute the working set size wss for each process in the system we can  then consider that  where dis the total demand for frames each process is actively using the pages  in its working set thus process i needs wss frames if the total demand is  greater than the total number of available frames d m thrashing will occur  because some processes will not have enough frames  once l has been selected use of the working set model is simple the  operating system monitors the working set of each process and allocates to  that working set enough frames to provide it with its working set size if there  are enough extra frames another process can be initiated if the sum of the  working set sizes increases exceeding the total number of available frames  the operating system selects a process to suspend the process s pages are  written out swapped and its frames are reallocated to other processes the  suspended process can be restarted later  this working set strategy prevents thrashing while keeping the degree of  multiprogramming as high as possible thus it optimizes cpu utilization  the difficulty with the working set model is keeping track of the working  set the working set window is a moving window at each memory reference  a new reference appears at one end and the oldest reference drops off the other  end a page is in the working set if it is referenced anywhere in the working set  window  we can approximate the working set model with a fixed interval timer  interrupt and a reference bit for example assum e that l equals  references and that we can cause a timer interrupt every references  when we get a timer interrupt we copy and clear the reference bit values for  each page thus if a page fault occurs we can examine the current reference  bit and two in memory bits to determine whether a page was used within the  last to references if it was used at least one of these bits will be  on if it has not been used these bits will be off those pages with at least one  bit on will be considered to be in the working set note that this arrangement  is not entirely accurate because we cannot tell where within an interval of   a reference occurred we can reduce the uncertainty by increasing the  number of history bits and the frequency of interrupts for example bits  and interrupts every references however the cost to service these more  frequent interrupts will be correspondingly higher   chapter   number of frames  figure page fault frequency   page fault frequency  the working set model is successful and knowledge of the working set can  be useful for prepaging section  but it seems a clumsy way to control  thrashilcg a strategy that uses the takes a more  direct approach  the specific problem is how to prevent thrashilcg thrashing has a high  page fault rate thus we want to control the page fault rate when it is too  high we know that the process needs more frames conversely if the page fault  rate is too low then the process may have too many frames we can establish  upper and lower bounds on the desired page fault rate figure  if the  actual page fault rate exceeds the upper limit we allocate the process another  frame if the page fault rate falls below the lower limit we remove a frame  from the process thus we can directly measure and control the page fault  rate to prevent thrashing  as with the working set strategy we may have to suspend a process if the  page fault rate ilccreases and no free frames are available we must select some  process and suspend it the freed frames are then distributed to processes with  high page fault rates  consider a sequential read of a file on disk using the standard system calls  open read  and write  each file access requires a system call and disk  access alternatively we can use the virtual memory techniques discussed  so far to treat file i as routine memory accesses this approach known as  a file allows a part of the virtual address space to be logically  associated with the file as we shall see this can lead to significant performance  increases when performing i    working sets and page faultrates  there is a directrelationship between the working set of a process and its  page fault rate typically as shown in figure the working set ofa process  changes pver time as references to data and code sections move from one  locality to another assuming there is sufficient memory to store the working  set of a process that is the processis ot thrashing tbe page fault rate of  the process will transition between peaks and valleys over time this general  behavior is shown in figure  page  fault  rate working set  time  figure page fault rate over time  a peak in the page fault rate occurs when we begin demand paging a new  locality however once the working set of this new locality is in memory  the page fault rate falls when the process moves to a new working set the  page fault rate rises toward a peak once again returning to a lower rate once  the new working set is loaded into memory the span oftime between the  start of one peak and the start of thenext peak represents the transition from  one working set to another   basic mechanism  memory mapping a file is accomplished by mapping a disk block to a page or  pages in memory initial access to the file proceeds through ordinary demand  paging resulting in a page fault however a page sized portion of the file  is read from the file system into a physical page some systems may opt  to read in more than a page sized chunk of memory at a time subsequent  reads and writes to the file are handled as routine memory accesses thereby  simplifying file access and usage by allowing the system to manipulate files  through memory rather than incurring the overhead of using the read and  write system calls similarly as file l is done in memory as opposed  to using system calls that involve disk i file access is much faster as well  note that writes to the file mapped in memory are not necessarily  imm ediate synchronous writes to the file on disk some systems may choose  to update the physical file when the operating system periodically checks   chapter  whether the page in memory has been modified when the file is closed all the  memory mapped data are written back to disk and ren loved from the virtual  memory of the process  some operating systems provide memory mapping only through a specific  system call and use the standard system calls to perform all other file i  however some systems choose to memory map a file regardless of whether  the file was specified as memory mapped let s take solaris as an example if  a file is specified as memory mapped using the mmap system call solaris  maps the file into the address space of the process if a file is opened and  accessed using ordinary system calls such as open read and write  solaris still memory maps the file however the file is mapped to the kernel  address space regardless of how the file is opened then solaris treats all  file i as memory mapped allowing file access to take place via the efficient  memory subsystem  multiple processes may be allowed to map the same file concurrently  to allow sharing of data writes by any of the processes modify the data in  virtual memory and can be seen by all others that map the same section of  the file given our earlier discussions of virtual memory it should be clear  how the sharing of memory mapped sections of memory is implemented  the virtual memory map of each sharing process points to the same page of  physical memory the page that holds a copy of the disk block this memory  sharing is illustrated in figure the memory mapping system calls can  also support copy on write functionality allowing processes to share a file in  read only mode but to have their own copies of any data they modify so that  r  i  i i   r   i i  i i  i i i i i i j r rl r  i i i i r i i i i   i i  i i  i i i f   c c

using memory mapped   access to the shared data is coordinated the processes involved might use one  of the mechanisms for achieving mutual exclusion described in chapter  in many ways the sharing of memory mapped files is similar to shared  memory as described in section  not all systems use the same mechanism  for both on unix and linux systems for example memory mapping is  accomplished with the mmap system call whereas shared memory is achieved  with the posix compliant shmget and shmat systems calls section    on windows nt and xp systems however shared memory is  accomplished by memory mapping files on these systems processes can  communicate using shared memory by having the communicating processes  memory map the same file into their virtual address spaces the memory\\xad mapped file serves as the region of shared memory between the communicating  processes figure  in the following section we illustrate support in the  win api for shared memory using memory mapped files   shared memory in the win api  the general outline for creating a region of shared memory using memory\\xad mapped files in the win api involves first creating a file mapping for the file  to be mapped and then establishing a view of the mapped file in a process s  virtual address space a second process can then open and create a view of  the mapped file in its virtual address space the mapped file represents the  shared menwry object that will enable communication to take place between  the processes  we next illustrate these steps in more detail in this example a producer  process first creates a shared memory object using the memory mapping  features available in the win api the producer then writes a message  to shared m emory after that a consumer process opens a mapping to the  shared memory object and reads the message written by the consum er  to establish a memory mapped file a process first opens the file to be  mapped with the createfile function which returns a handle to the  opened file the process then creates a mapping of this file handle using  the createfilemapping function once the file mapping is established the  process then establishes a view of the mapped file in its virtual address space  with the mapviewdffile function the view of the mapped file represents  the portion of the file being mapped in the virtual address space of the process   chapter

figure  we eliminate much of the error  checking for code brevity  the call to createfilemapping creates a named shared memory object  called sharedobj ect the consumer process will communicate using this  shared memory segment by creating a mapping to the same named object  the producer then creates a view of the memory mapped file in its virtual  address space by passing the last three parameters the value it indicates  that the mapped view is the entire file it could instead have passed values  specifying an offset and size thus creating a view containing only a subsection  of the

shared memory using the win api  into memory when the mapping is established rather the mapped file may be  demand paged thus bringing pages into memory only as they are accessed  the mapviewoffile fmction returns a pointer to the shared memory object  any accesses to this memory location are thus accesses to the memory mapped  file in this iistance the producer process writes the message shared memory  message to shared memory  a program illustrating how the consumer process establishes a view of  the named shared memory object is shown in figure this program is  somewhat simpler than the one shown in figure as all that is necessary  is for the process to create a mapping to the existiig named shared memory  object the consumer process must also create a view of the mapped file just  as the producer process did ii the program in figure the consumer then  reads from shared memory the message shared memory message thatwas  written by the producer process  finally both processes remove the view of the mapped file with a call to  unmapviewoffile  we provide a programming exercise at the end of this  chapter using shared memory with memory mapping in the win api   memory mapped i  in the case of i as mentioned in section  each i controller includes  registers to hold commands and the data being transferred usually special i  instructions allow data transfers between these registers and system memory   chapter   to allow more convenient access to i devices many computer architectures  provide in this case ranges of memory addresses are  set aside and are mapped to the device registers reads and writes to these  memory addresses cause the data to be transferred to and from the device  registers this method is appropriate for devices that have fast response times  such as video controllers in the ibm pc each location on the screen is mapped  to a n emory location displaying text on the screen is almost as easy as writing  the text into the appropriate memory mapped locations  memory mapped i o is also convenient for other devices such as the serial  and parallel ports used to connect modems and printers to a computer the  cpu transfers data through these kinds of devices by reading and writing a few  device registers called an i to send out a long string of bytes through a  memory mapped serial port the cpu writes one data byte to the data register  and sets a bit in the control register to signal that the byte is available the device  takes the data byte and then clears the bit in the control register to signal that  it is ready for the next byte then the cpu can transfer the next byte if the  cpu uses polling to watch the control bit constantly looping to see whether  the device is ready this method of operation is called  if the cpu does not poll the control bit but instead receives an interrupt when  the device is ready for the next byte the data transfer is said to be  when a process running in user rnode requests additional memory pages  are allocated from the list of free page frames maintained by the kernel  this list is typically populated using a page replacement algorithm such as  those discussed in section and most likely contains free pages scattered  throughout physical memory as explained earlier remember too that if a  user process requests a single byte of memory internal fragmentation will  result as the process will be granted an entire page frame  kernel memory however is often allocated from a free memory pool  different from the list used to satisfy ordinary user mode processes there  are two primary reasons for this  the kernel requests memory for data structures of varying sizes some of  which are less than a page in size as a result the kernel must use memory  conservatively and attempt to minimize waste due to fragmentation this  is especially important because many operating systems do not subject  kernel code or data to the paging system   pages allocated to user mode processes do not necessarily have to be in  contiguous physical memory however certain hardware devices interact  directly with physical memory without the benefit of a virtual memory  interface and consequently may require memory residing in physically  contiguous pages  in the following sections we examine two strategies for managing free memory  that is assigned to kernel processes the buddy system and slab allocation     buddy system  tbe buddy system allocates memory from a fixed size segment consisting of  physically contiguous pages memory is allocated from this segment using a  power of allocator which satisfies requests in units sized as a power of   kb kb kb and so forth a request in units not appropriately sized is  rounded up to the next highest power of for example if a request for kb  is made it is satisfied with a kb segment  let s consider a simple example assume the size of a memory segment  is initially kb and the kernel requests kb of memory the segment is  initially divided into two buddies which we will call al and ar each  kb in size one of these buddies is further divided into two kb buddies\\xad bland br however the next highest power of from kb is kb so either  bt or br is again divided into two kb buddies cl and cr one of these  buddies is used to satisfy the kb request this scheme is illustrated in figure   where cl is the segment allocated to the kb request  an advantage of the buddy system is how quickly adjacent buddies can be  combined to form larger segments using a teclmique known as coalescing in  figure for example when the kernel releases the cl unit it was allocated  the system can coalesce c l and c r into a kb segment this segment b l can  in turn be coalesced with its buddy b r to form a kb segment ultimately  we can end up with the original kb segment  the obvious drawback to the buddy system is that rounding up to the  next highest power of is very likely to cause fragmentation within allocated  segments for example a kb request can only be satisfied with a  kb segment in fact we cannot guarantee that less than percent of the  allocated unit will be wasted due to internal fragmentation in the following  section we explore a memory allocation scheme where no space is lost due to  fragmentation  physically contiguous pages   kb  figure buddy system allocation   chapter   slab allocation  a second strategy for allocating kernel memory is known as a  is made up of one or nwre physically contiguous pages a consists of  one or more slabs there is a single cache for each unique kernel data structure   for example a separate cache for the data structure representing process  descriptors a separate cache for file objects a separate cache for semaphores  and so forth each cache is populated with that are instantiations of the  kernel data structure the cache represents for example the cache representing  semaphores stores instances of semaphore objects the cache representing  process descriptors stores instances of process descriptor objects and so forth  the relationship between slabs caches and objects is shown in figure  the figure shows two kernel objects kb in size and three objects kb in size  these objects are stored in their respective caches  the slab allocation algorithm uses caches to store kernel objects when a  cache is created a number of objects which are initially marked as free are  allocated to the cache the number of objects in the cache depends on the size  of the associated slab for example a kb slab made up of three continguous   kb pages could store six kb objects initially all objects in the cache are  marked as free when a new object for a kernel data structure is needed the  allocator can assign any free object from the cache to satisfy the request the  object assigned from the cache is marked as used  let s consider a scenario in which the kernel requests memory from the  slab allocator for an object representing a process descriptor in linux systems  a process descriptor is of the type struct task struct which requires  approximately kb of memory when the linux kernel creates a new task  it requests the necessary memory for the struct task struct object from its  cache the cache will fulfill the request using a struct task struct object  that has already been allocated in a slab and is marked as free  in linux a slab may be in one of three possible states  kernel objects slabs   kb  objects   kb  objects  figure slab allocation physically  contiguous  pages    full all objects in the slab are marked as used  empty all objects in the slab are marked as free  partial the slab consists of both used and free objects  the slab allocator first attempts to satisfy the request with a free object in a  partial slab if none exist a free object is assigned from an empty slab if no  empty slabs are available a new slab is allocated from contiguous physical  pages and assigned to a cache memory for the object is allocated from this  slab  the slab allocator provides two main benefits  no memory is wasted due to fragmentation fragn entation is not an  issue because each unique kernel data structure has an associated cache  and each cache is made up of one or more slabs that are divided into  chunks the size of the objects being represented thus when the kernel  requests memory for an object the slab allocator returns the exact amount  of memory required to represent the object  memory requests can be satisfied quickly the slab allocation scheme  is thus particularly effective for mm aging memory when objects are  frequently allocated and deallocated as is often the case with requests  from the kernel the act of allocating and releasing memory can be  a time consuming process however objects are created in advance and  thus can be quickly allocated from the cache furthermore when the  kernel has finished with an object and releases it it is marked as free and  returned to its cache thus making it immediately available for subsequent  requests fi·om the kernel  the slab allocator first appeared in the solaris kernel because of its  general purpose nature this allocator is now also used for certain user mode  memory requests in solaris linux originally used the buddy system however  beginning with version the linux kernel adopted the slab allocator  the major decisions that we make for a paging system are the selections of  a replacement algorithm and an allocation policy which we discussed earlier  in this chapter there are many other considerations as well and we discuss  several of them here   prepaging  an obvious property of pure demand paging is the large number of page faults  that occur when a process is started this situation results from trying to get the  initial locality into memory the same situation may arise at other times for  instance when a swapped out process is restarted all its are on the disk  and each must be brought in by its own page fault is an attempt to  prevent this high level of initial paging the strategy is to bring into memory at   chapter  one tin e all the pages that will be needed some operating systerns notably  solaris prepage the page frames for small files  in a system using the working set model for example we keep with each  process a list of the pages in its working set if we must suspend a process   due to an i wait or a lack of free frames we remember the working set for  that process when the process is to be resumed because i has finished or  enough free frames have become available we automatically bring back into  memory its entire working set before restarting the process  prepaging may offer an advantage in some cases the question is simply  whether the cost of using prepaging is less than the cost of servicing the  corresponding page faults it may well be the case that many of the pages  brought back into memory by prepaging will not be used  assume that s pages are prepaged and a fraction a of these s pages is  actually used   a   the question is whether the cost of the s a saved  page faults is greater or less than the cost of prepaging s  a unnecessary  pages if a is close to prepaging loses if a is close to prepaging wins   page size  the designers of an operating system for an existing machine seldom have  a choice concerning the page size however when new machines are being  designed a decision regarding the best page size must be made as you might  expect there is no single best page size rather there is a set of factors that  support various sizes page sizes are invariably powers of generally ranging  from  to  bytes  how do we select a page size one concern is the size of the page table for  a given virtual memory space decreasing the page size increases the number  of pages and hence the size of the page table for a virtual memory of mb   for example there would be pages of bytes but only pages  of bytes because each active process must have its own copy of the page  table a large page size is desirable  memory is better utilized with smaller pages however if a process is  allocated memory starting at location and continuing until it has as much  as it needs it probably will not end exactly on a page boundary thus a part  of the final page must be allocated because pages are the units of allocation  but will be unused creating internal fragmentation assuming independence  of process size and page size we can expect that on the average half of the  final page of each process will be wasted this loss is only bytes for a page  of bytes but is bytes for a page of bytes to minimize internal  fragmentation then we need a small page size  another problem is the time required to read or write a page i time is  composed of seek latency and transfer times transfer time is proportional  to the amount transferred that is the page size a fact that would seem  to argue for a small page size however as we shall see in section   latency and seek time normally dwarf transfer time at a transfer rate of  mb per second it takes only milliseconds to transfer bytes latency  time though is perhaps milliseconds and seek time milliseconds of  the total i time milliseconds therefore only percent is attributable  to the actual transfer doubling the page size increases i time to only  milliseconds it takes milliseconds to read a single page of bytes but     milliseconds to read the sam e amount as two pages of bytes each  thus a desire to minimize time argues for a larger page size  with a smaller page size though to tall should be reduced since locality  will be improved a smaller page size allows each page to match program  locality more accurately for example consider a process kb in size of  which only half kb is actually used in an execution if we have only one  large page we must bring in the entire page a total of kb transferred and  allocated if instead we had pages of only byte then we could bring in only  the kb that are actually used resulting in only kb transferred and  allocated with a smaller page size we have better allowing us to  isolate only the memory that is actually needed with a larger page size we  must allocate and transfer not only what is needed but also anything else that  happens to be in the page whether it is needed or not thus a smaller page  size should result in less i and less total allocated memory  but did you notice that with a page size of byte we would have a page  fault for each byte a process of kb that used only half of that memory  would generate only one page fault with a page size of kb but page  faults with a page size of byte each page fault generates the large amount  of overhead needed for processing the interrupt saving registers replacing a  page queueing for the paging device and updating tables to minimize the  number of page faults we need to have a large page size  other factors must be considered as well such as the relationship between  page size and sector size on the paging device the problem has no best  answer as we have seen some factors internal fragmentation locality argue  for a small page size whereas others table size i time argue for a large  page size however the historical trend is toward larger page sizes indeed the  first edition of operating system concepts used bytes as the upper  bound on page sizes and this value was the most common page size in  modern systems may now use much larger page sizes as we will see in the  following section   tlb reach  in chapter we introduced the of the tlb recall that the hit ratio  for the tlb refers to the percentage of virtual address translations that are  resolved in the tlb rather than the page table clearly the hit ratio is related  to the number of entries in the tlb and the way to increase the hit ratio is  by increasing the number of entries in the tlb this however does not come  cheaply as the associative memory used to construct the tlb is both expensive  and power hungry  related to the hit ratio is a similar metric the the tlb reach refers  to the amount of memory accessible from the tlb and is simply the number  of entries multiplied by the page size ideally the working set for a process is  stored in the tlb if it is not the process will spend a considerable amount of  time resolving memory references in the page table rather than the tlb if we  double the number of entries in the tlb we double the tlb reach however  for some memory intensive applications this may still prove insufficient for  storing the working set  another approacl for increasing the tlb reach is to either increase the size  of the page or provide multiple page sizes if we increase the page size say   chapter  from kb to kb we quadruple the tlb reach however this may lead to  an increase in fragmentation for some applications that do not require such  a large page size as kb alternatively an operating system may provide  several different page sizes for example the ultrasparc supports page sizes  of kb kb kb and mb of these available pages sizes solaris uses  both kb and mb page sizes and with a entry tlb the tlb reach for  solaris ranges from kb with kb pages to mb with mb pages for the  majority of applications the kb page size is sufficient although solaris maps  the first mb of kernel code and data with two mb pages solaris also allows  applications such as databases to take advantage of the large mb page  size  providing support for multiple page sizes requires the operating system   not hardware to manage the tlb for example one of the fields in a  tlb entry must indicate the size of the page frame corresponding to the  tlb entry managing the tlb in software and not hardware comes at a cost  in performance however the increased hit ratio and tlb reach offset the  performance costs indeed recent trends indicate a move toward software\\xad managed tlbs and operating system support for multiple page sizes the  ultrasparc mips and alpha architectures employ software managed tlbs  the powerpc and pentium manage the tlb in hardware   inverted page tables  section introduced the concept of the inverted page table the purpose  of this form of page management is to reduce the amount of physical memory  needed to track virtual to physical address translations we accomplish this  savings by creating a table that has one entry per page of physical memory  indexed by the pair process id page number  because they keep information about which virtual memory page is stored  in each physical frame inverted page tables reduce the amount of physical  memory needed to store this information however the inverted page table  no longer contains complete information about the logical address space of a  process and that information is required if a referenced page is not currently  in memory demand paging requires this information to process page faults  for the information to be available an external page table one per process  must be kept each such table looks like the traditional per process page table  and contains information on where each virtual page is located  but do external page tables negate the utility of inverted page tables since  these tables are referenced only when a page fault occurs they do not need to  be available quickly instead they are themselves paged in and out of memory  as necessary unfortunately a page fault may now cause the virtual memory  n anager to generate another page fault as it pages in the external page table it  needs to locate the virtual page on the backing store this special case requires  careful handling in the kernel and a delay in the page lookup processing   program structure  demand paging is designed to be transparent to the user program in many  cases the user is completely unaware of the paged nature of memory in other  cases however system performance can be improved if the user or compiler  has an awareness of the underlying demand paging    let s look at a contrived but informative example assume that pages are   words in size consider a c program whose function is to initialize to  each element of a by array the following code is typical notice that the array is stored row major that is the array is stored  data for pages of words each row takes one page thus  the preceding code zeros one word in each page then another word in each  page and so on if the operating system allocates fewer than frames to the  entire program then its execution will result in x  page faults  in contrast suppose we change the code to  this code zeros all the words on one page before starting the next page  reducing the number of page faults to  careful selection of data structures and programming structures can  increase locality and hence lower the page fault rate and the number of pages in  the working set for example a stack has good locality since access is always  made to the top a hash table in contrast is designed to scatter references  producing bad locality of course locality of reference is just one measure of  the efficiency of the use of a data structure other heavily weighted factors  include search speed total number of memory references and total number of  pages touched  at a later stage the compiler and loader can have a sigicificant effect on  paging separating code and data and generating reentrant code means that  code pages can be read only and hence will never be modified clean pages  do not have to be paged out to be replaced the loader can avoid placing  routines across page boundaries keeping each routine completely in one page  routines that call each other many times can be packed into the same page  this packaging is a variant of the bin packing problem of operations research  try to pack the variable sized load segments into the fixed sized pages so that  interpage references are minimized such an approach is particularly useful  for large page sizes  the choice of programming language can affect paging as well for  example c and c use pointers frequently and pointers tend to randomize  access to memory thereby potentially diminishing a process s locality some  studies have shown that object oriented programs also tend to have a poor  locality of reference   chapter    interlock  when demand paging is used we sometimes need to allow some of the pages  to be in n emory one such situation occurs when i is done to or from  user virtual memory l is often implemented by a separate i processor  for example a controller for a usb storage device is generally given the number  of bytes to transfer and a memory address for the buffer figure  when  the transfer is complete the cpu is interrupted  we must be sure the following sequence of events does not occur a process  issues an i request and is put in a queue for that i o device meanwhile the  cpu is given to other processes these processes cause page faults and one of  them using a global replacement algorithm replaces the page containing the  memory buffer for the waiting process the pages are paged out some time  later when the i o request advances to the head of the device queue the i o  occurs to the specified address however this frame is now being used for a  different page belonging to another process  there are two common solutions to this problem one solution is never to  execute i to user memory instead data are always copied between system  memory and user memory i takes place only between system memory  and the i device to write a block on tape we first copy the block to system  memory and then write it to tape this extra copying may result in unacceptably  high overhead  another solution is to allow pages to be locked into memory here a lock  bit is associated with every frame if the frame is locked it cannot be selected  for replacement under this approach to write a block on tape we lock into  memory the pages containing the block the system can then continue as  usual locked pages cannot be replaced when the i o is complete the pages  are unlocked  figure the reason why frames used for must be in memory     lock bits are used in various situations frequently some or all of the  operating system kernel is locked into memory as many operating systems  cannot tolerate a page fault caused by the kernel  another use for a lock bit involves normal page replacement consider  the following sequence of events a low priority process faults selecting a  replacement frame the paging system reads the necessary page into memory  ready to continue the low priority process enters the ready queue and waits  for the cpu since it is a low priority process it may not be selected by the  cpu scheduler for a time while the low priority process waits a high priority  process faults looking for a replacement the paging system sees a page that  is in memory but has not been referenced or modified it is the page that the  low priority process just brought in this page looks like a perfect replacement  it is clean and will not need to be written out and it apparently has not been  used for a long time  whether the high priority process should be able to replace the low priority  process is a policy decision after all we are simply delaying the low priority  process for the benefit of the high priority process however we are wasting  the effort spent to bring in the page for the low priority process if we decide  to prevent replacement of a newly brought in page until it can be used at least  once then we can use the lock bit to implement this mechanism when a page  is selected for replacement its lock bit is turned on it remains on until the  faulting process is again dispatched  using a lock bit can be dangerous the lock bit may get turned on but  never turned off should this situation occur because of a bug in the operating  system for example the locked frame becomes unusable on a single user  system the overuse of locking would hurt only the user doing the locking  multiuser systems must be less trusting of users for instance solaris allows  locking hints but it is free to disregard these hints if the free frame pool  becomes too small or if an individual process requests that too many pages be  locked in memory  in this section we describe how windows xp and solaris implement virtual  memory   windows xp  windows xp implements virtual memory using demand paging with  clustering handles page faults by bringing in not only the faultil g  page also several pages following the faulting page when a process is first  created it is assigned a working set minimum and maximum the  is the minimum number of pages the process is guaranteed to  in memory if sufficient memory is available a process may be assigned as  many pages as its for most applications the value  of working set minimum and working set maximum is and pages  respectively in some circumstances a process may be allowed to exceed its  working set maximum the virtual memory manager maintains a list of free  page frames associated with this list is a threshold value that is used to   chapter  indicate whether sufficient free memory is available if a page fault occurs for a  process that is below its working set maximum the virtual memory manager  allocates a page from this list of free pages if a process that is at its working set  rnaximum incurs a page fault it must select a page for replacement using a  local page replacement policy  when the amount of free memory falls below the threshold the virtual  memory manager uses a tactic known as to  restore the value above the threshold automatic working set trimming works  by evaluating the number of pages allocated to processes if a process has  been allocated more pages than its working set minimum the virtual memory  manager removes pages until the process reaches its working set minimum a  process that is at its working set minimum may be allocated pages from the  free page frame list once sufficient free memory is available  the algorithm used to determine which page to remove from a working set  depends on the type of processor on single processor x systems windows  xp uses a variation of the clock algorithm discussed in section  on  alpha and multiprocessor x systems clearing the reference bit may require  invalidatil g the entry in the translation look aside buffer on other processors  rather than incurring this overhead windows xp uses a variation on the fifo  algorithm discussed in section    solaris  in solaris when a thread incurs a page fault the kernel assigns a page to  the faulting thread from the list of free pages it maintains therefore it is  imperative that the kernel keep a sufficient amount of free memory available  associated with this list of free pages is a parameter zotsfree that represents  a threshold to begin paging the lotsfree parameter is typically set to the  size of the physical memory four times per second the kernel checks whether  the amount of free memory is less than lotsfree if the number of free pages falls  below lotsfree a process known as a pageout starts up the pageout process is  similar to the second chance algorithm described in section  except that  it uses two hands while scanning pages rather than one the pageout process  works as follows the front hand of the clock scans all pages in memory setting  the reference bit to later the back hand of the clock examines the reference  bit for the pages in memory appending each page whose reference bit is still set  to to the free list and writing to disk its contents if modified solaris maintains  a cache list of pages that have been freed but have not yet been overwritten  the free list contains frames that have invalid contents pages can be reclaimed  from the cache list if they are accessed before being moved to the free list  the pageout algorithm uses several parameters to control the rate at which  pages are scam ed known as the scanrate the scanrate is expressed in pages  per second and ranges from slowscan to fastscan when free memory falls  below lotsfree scanning occurs at slowscan pages per second and progresses  to fastscan depending on the amount of free memory available the default  value of slowscan is pages per second fasts can is typically set to the value   total physical pages pages per second with a maximum of pages per  second this is shown in figure withfastscan set to the maximum  the distance in pages between the hands of the clock is determil ed by  a system parameter handspread the amount of time between the front hand s    fastscan  cll  §  c   j u en    slowscan  minfree desfree  amount of free memory  figure solaris page scanner   lotsfree  clearing a bit and the back hand s investigating its value depends on the scanrate  and the handspread if scam ate is pages per second and handspread is  pages seconds can pass between the time a bit is set by the front hand  and the time it is checked by the back hand however because of the demands  placed on the memory system a scanrate of several thousand is not uncommon  this means that the amount of time between clearing and investigating a bit is  often a few seconds  as mentioned above the pageout process checks memory four times per  second however if free memory falls below desfree figure  pageout  will nm times per second with the intention of keeping at least desfree  free memory available if the pageout process is unable to keep the amount  of free memory at desfree for a second average the kernel begins swapping  processes thereby freeing all pages allocated to swapped processes in general  the kernel looks for processes that have been idle for long periods of time if  the system is unable to maintain the amount of free memory at minfree the  pageout process is called for every request for a new page  recent releases of the solaris kernel have provided enhancements of  the paging algorithm one such enhancement involves recognizing pages  from shared libraries pages belonging to libraries that are being shared by  several processes even if they are eligible to be claimed by the scanner\\xad are skipped during the page scanning process another enhancement concerns  distinguishing pages that have been allocated to processes from pages allocated  to regularfiles this is known as and is covered in section   it is desirable to be able to execute a process whose logical address space is  larger than the available physical address space virtual memory is a technique   chapter  that enables us to map a large logical address space onto a smaller physical  menlory virtual memory allows us to run extremely large processes and to  raise the degree of multiprogramming increasing cpu utilization further it  frees application programmers from worrying about memory availability in  addition with virtual memory several processes can share system libraries  and memory virtual memory also enables us to use an efficient type of process  creation known as copy on write wherein parent and child processes share  actual pages of memory  virtual memory is commonly implemented by demand paging pure  demand paging never brings in a page until that page is referenced the first  reference causes a page fault to the operating system the operating system  kernel consults an internal table to determine where the page is located on the  backing store it then finds a free frame and reads the page in from the backing  store the page table is updated to reflect this change and the instruction that  caused the page fault is restarted this approach allows a process to run even  though its entire memory image is not in main memory at once as long as the  page fault rate is reasonably low performance is acceptable  we can use demand paging to reduce the number of frames allocated to  a process this arrangement can increase the degree of multiprogramming   allowing more processes to be available for execution at one time and in  theory at least the cpu utilization of the system it also allows processes  to be run even though their memory requirements exceed the total available  physical memory such processes run in virtual memory  if total memory requirements exceed the capacity of physical memory  then it may be necessary to replace pages from memory to free frames for  new pages various page replacement algorithms are used fifo page replace\\xad ment is easy to program but suffers from belady s anomaly optimal page  replacement requires future knowledge lru replacement is an approxima\\xad tion of optimal page replacement but even it may be difficult to implement  most page replacement algorithms such as the second chance algorithm are  approximations of lru replacement  in addition to a page replacement algorithm a frame allocation policy  is needed allocation can be fixed suggesting local page replacement or  dynamic suggesting global replacement the working set model assumes that  processes execute in localities the working set is the set of pages in the current  locality accordingly each process should be allocated enough frames for its  current working set if a process does not have enough memory for its working  set it will thrash providing enough frames to each process to avoid thrashing  may require process swapping and schedulil g  most operating systems provide features for memory mappilg files thus  allowing file i to be treated as routine memory access the win api  implements shared memory through memory mappilg files  kernel processes typically req ire memory to be allocated using pages  that are physically contiguous the buddy system allocates memory to kernel  processes in units sized according to a power of which often results in  fragmentation slab allocators assign kernel data structures to caches associated  with slabs which are made up of one or more physically contiguous pages  with slab allocation no memory is wasted due to fragmentation and memory  requests can be satisfied quickly    in addition to reqmnng that we solve the major problems of

necessary for implementation  of virtual memory in six different architectures including the ultrasparc   part five  since main memory is usually too small to accommodate all the data and  programs permanently the computer system must provide secondary  storage to back up main memory modern computer systems use disks  as the primary on line storage medium for information both programs  and data the file system provides the mechanism for on line storage  of and access to both data and programs residing on the disks a file  is a collection of related information defined by its creator the files are  mapped by the operating system onto physical devices files are normally  organized into directories for ease of use  the devices that attach to a computer vary in many aspects some  devices transfer a character or a block of characters at a time some  can be accessed only sequentially others randomly some transfer  data synchronously others asynchronously some are dedicated some  shared they can be read only or read write they vary greatly in speed  in many ways they are also the slowest major component of the  computer  because of all this device variation the operating system needs to  provide a wide range of functionality to applications to allow them to  control all aspects of the devices one key goal of an operating system s   subsystem is to provide the simplest interface possible to the rest of  the system because devices are a performance bottleneck another key  is to optimize for maximum concurrency    r  for most users the file system is the most visible aspect of an operating system  it provides the mechanism for on line storage of and access to both data and  programs of the operating system and all the users of the computer system the  file system consists of two distinct parts a collection of files each storing related  data and a directory structure which organizes and provides information about  all the files in the system file systems live on devices which we explore fully  irl the following chapters but touch upon here in this chapter we consider  the various aspects of files and the major directory structures we also discuss  the semantics of sharing files among multiple processes users and computers  finally we discuss ways to handle file protection necessary when we have  multiple users and we want to control who may access files and how files may  be accessed  to explain the function of file systems  to describe the interfaces to file systems  to discuss file system design tradeoffs including access methods file  sharing file locking and directory structures  to explore file system protection  computers can store information on various storage media such as magnetic  disks magnetic tapes and optical disks so that the computer system will  be convenient to use the operating system provides a uniform logical view  of information storage the operating system abstracts from the physical  properties of its storage devices to define a logical storage unit the file files are  mapped by the operating system onto physical devices these storage devices  are usually nonvolatile so the contents are persistent through power failures  and system reboots     chapter  a file is a named collection of related information that is recorded on  secondary storage from a user s perspective a file is the smallest allotment  of logical secondary storage that is data cannot be written to secondary  storage unless they are within a file commonly files represent programs both  source and object forms and data data files may be numeric alphabetic  alphanumeric or binary files may be free form such as text files or may be  formatted rigidly in general a file is a sequence of bits bytes lines or records  the meaning of which is defined by the file s creator and user the concept of  a file is thus extremely general  the information in a file is defined by its creator many different types  of information may be stored in a file source programs object programs  executable programs numeric data text payroll records graphic images  sound recordings and so on a file has a certain defined which  depends on its type a text file is a sequence of characters organized into  lines and possibly pages a source file is a sequence of subroutines and  functions each of which is further organized as declarations followed by  executable statements an object file is a sequence of bytes organized in to  blocks nnderstandable by the system s linker an executable file is a series of  code sections that the loader can bring into memory and execute   file attributes  a file is named for the convenience of its human users and is referred to by  its name a name is usually a string of characters such as example c some  systems differentiate between uppercase and lowercase characters in names  whereas other systems do not when a file is named it becomes independent  of the process the user and even the system that created it for instance one  user might create the file example c and another user might edit that file by  specifying its name the file s owner might write the file to a floppy disk send  it in an e mail or copy it across a network and it could still be called example c  on the destination system  a file s attributes vary from one operating system to another but typically  consist of these  name the symbolic file name is the only information kept in human\\xad readable form  identifier this unique tag usually a number identifies the file within the  file system it is the non human readable name for the file  type this information is needed for systems that support different types  of files  location this information is a pointer to a device and to the location of  the file on that device  size the current size of the file in bytes words or blocks and possibly  the maximum allowed size are included in this attribute  protection access control information determines who can do reading  writing executing and so on    time date and user identification this information may be kept for  creation last modification and last use these data can be useful for  protection security and usage monitoring  the information about all files is kept in the directory structure which also  resides on secondary storage typically a directory entry consists of the file s  name and its unique identifier the identifier in turn locates the other file  attributes it may take more than a kilobyte to record this information for  each file in a system with many files the size of the directory itself may be  megabytes because directories like files must be nonvolatile they must be  stored on the device and brought into memory piecemeal as needed   file operations  a file is an to define a file properly we need to consider the  operations that can be performed on files the operating system can provide  system calls to create write read reposition delete and truncate files let s  examine what the operating system must do to perform each of these six basic  file operations it should then be easy to see how other similar operations such  as renaming a file can be implemented  creating a file two steps are necessary to create a file first space in the  file system must be found for the file we discuss how to allocate space for  the file in chapter second an entry for the new file must be made in  the directory  writing a file to write a file we make a system call specifying both the  name of the file and the information to be written to the file given the  name of the file the system searches the directory to find the file s location  the system must keep a write pointer to the location in the file where the  next write is to take place the write pointer must be updated whenever a  write occurs  reading a file to read from a file we use a system call that specifies the  name of the file and where in memory the next block of the file should  be put again the directory is searched for the associated entry and the  system needs to keep a read pointer to the location in the file where the  next read is to take place once the read has taken place the read pointer  is updated because a process is usually either reading from or writing to  a file the current operation location can be kept as a per process   both the read and write operations use this same  pointer saving space and reducing system complexity  repositioning within a file the directory is searched for the appropriate  entry and the current file position pointer is repositioned to a given value  repositioning within a file need not involve any actual i this file  operation is also kn own as a file seek  deleting a file to delete a file we search the directory for the named file  having found the associated directory entry we release all file space so  that it can be reused by other files and erase the directory entry   chapter  truncating a file the user may want to erase the contents of a file but  keep its attributes rather than forcing the user to delete the file and then  recreate it this function allows all attributes to remain unchanged except  for file length but lets the file be reset to length zero and its file space  released  these six basic operations comprise the minimal set of required file  operations other common operations include appending new information  to the end of an existing file and renaming an existing file these primitive  operations can then be combined to perform other file operations for instance  we can create a copy of a file or copy the file to another i o device such as  a printer or a display by creating a new file and then reading from the old  and writing to the new we also want to have operations that allow a user to  get and set the various attributes of a file for example we may want to have  operations that allow a user to determine the status of a file such as the file s  length and to set file attributes such as the file s owner  most of the file operations mentioned involve searching the directory for  the entry associated with the named file to avoid this constant searching many  systems require that an open system call be made before a file is first used  actively the operating system keeps a small table called the  containing information about all open files when a file operation is requested  the file is specified via an index into this table so no searching is required  when the file is no longer being actively used it is closed by the process and  the operating system removes its entry from the open file table create and  delete are system calls that work with closed rather than open files  some systems implicitly open a file when the first reference to it is made  the file is automatically closed when the job or program that opened the  file terminates most systems however require that the programmer open a  file explicitly with the open system call before that file can be used the  open operation takes a file name and searches the directory copying the  directory entry into the open file table the open call can also accept access\\xad mode information create read only read write append only and so on  this mode is checked against the file s permissions if the request mode is  allowed the file is opened for the process the open system call typically  returns a pointer to the entry in the open file table this pointer not the actual  file name is used in all i operations avoiding any further searching and  simplifying the system call interface  the implementation of the open and close operations is more  complicated in an environment where several processes may open the file  simultaneously this may occur in a system where several different applications  open the same file at the same time typically the operating system uses two  levels of internal tables a per process table and a system wide table the per\\xad process table tracks all files that a process has open stored in this table is  information regarding the use of the file by the process for instance the  current file pointer for each file is found here access rights to the file and  accounting information can also be included  each entry in the per process table in turn points to a system wide open file  table the system wide table contains process independent information such  as the location of the file on disk access dates and file size once a file has been  opened by one process the system wide table includes an entry for the file    when another process executes an open calt a new entry is simply added  to the process s open file table pointing to the appropriate entry in the system\\xad wide table typically the open file table also has an open count associated with  each file to indicate how ncany processes have the file open each close  decreases this open count and when the open count reaches zero the file is no  longer in use and the file s entry is removed from the open file table  in summary several pieces of information are associated with an open file  file pointer on systems that do not include a file offset as part of the  read and write system calls the systein must track the last read\\xad write location as a current file position pointer this pointer is unique to  each process operating on the file and therefore must be kept separate from  the on disk file attributes  file open count as files are closed the operating system must reuse its  open file table entries or it could run out of space in the table because  multiple processes may have opened a file the system must wait for the  last file to close before removing the open file table entry the file open  counter tracks the number of opens and closes and reaches zero on the last  close the system can then remove the entry  disk location of the file most file operations require the system to modify  data within the file the information needed to locate the file on disk is  kept in memory so that the system does not have to read it from disk for  each operation  access rights each process opens a file in an access mode this information  is stored on the per process table so the operating system can allow or deny  subsequent i requests  some operating systems provide facilities for locking an open file or  sections of a file file locks allow one process to lock a file and prevent other  processes from gaining access to it file locks are useful for files that are shared  by several processes for example a system log file that can be accessed and  modified by a number of processes in the system  file locking in java  in the java api acquiring a lock requires firstobtaini ng the f i lechannel  fbr thefile to be locked the loc k method of the filechannel is used to  acquir o the lock the api of the lock ·method is  filelock lock l ong begin long end l ooleqn shared  where begin and end are the h giiningand ending positions of the region  being locked settingshared to true isfb shared locks setting shared  to false acquires the lock exclusively tice lock is released by invoking the  release of the filelock returned by the lock operati n  the program in figure illusttates file locking in java this program  acquires two locks on thefilefile txt the first half of the file is acquired as an  exclusive lock the lock for the second half is a shared lock   chapter  file locks provide functionality similar to reader writer locks covered in  section  a shared lock is akin to a reader lock in that several processes  can acquire the lock concurrently an exclusive lock behaves like a writer lock  only one process at a time can acquire such a lock it is important to note    that not au operating systems provide both types of locks some systems only  provide exclusive file locking  furthermore operating systems may provide either mandatory or advi\\xad sory file locking mechanisms if a lock is n andatory then once a process  acquires an exclusive lock the operating system will prevent any other process  from accessing the locked file for example assume a process acquires an  exclusive lock on the file system log if we attempt to open system log  from another process for example a text editor the operating system will  prevent access until the exclusive lock is released this occurs even if the text  editor is not written explicitly to acquire the lock alternatively if the lock  is advisory then the operating system will not prevent the text editor from  acquiring access to system log rather the text editor must be written so that  it manually acquires the lock before accessing the file in other words if the  locking scheme is mandatory the operating system ensures locking integrity  for advisory locking it is up to software developers to ensure that locks are  appropriately acquired and released as a general rule windows operating  systems adopt mandatory locking and unix systems employ advisory locks  the use of file locks requires the same precautions as ordinary process  synchronization for example programmers developing on systems with  mandatory locking must be careful to hold exclusive file locks only while  they are accessing the file otherwise they will prevent other processes from  accessing the file as well furthermore some measures must be taken to ensure  that two or more processes do not become involved in a deadlock while trying  to acquire file locks   file types  when we design a file system indeed an entire operating system we  always consider whether the operating system should recognize and support  file types if an operating system recognizes the type of a file it can then operate  on the file in reasonable ways for example a common mistake occurs when a  user tries to print the binary object form of a program this attempt normally  produces garbage however the attempt can succeed if the operating system  has been told that the file is a binary object program  a common technique for implementing file types is to include the type as  part of the file name the name is split into two parts a name and an extension  usually separated by a period character figure  in this way the user and  the operating system can tell from the name alone what the type of a file is  for example most operating systems allow users to specify a file name as a  sequence of characters followed by a period and terminated by an extension of  additional characters file name examples include resume doc server java and  readerthread c  the system uses the extension to indicate the type of the file and the type  of operations that can be done on that file only a file with a com exe or bat  extension can be executed for instance the com and exe files are two forms of  binary executable files whereas a bat file is a containing in ascii  format commands to the operating system ms dos recognizes only a few  extensions but application programs also use extensions to indicate file types  in which they are interested for example assemblers expect source files to have  an asm extension and the microsoft word word processor expects its files to   chapter  executable exe com bin ready to run machine  or none language program  object obj o compiled machine  language not linked  source code c cc java pas source code in various  asm a languages  batch bat sh commands to the command  interpreter  text txt doc textual data documents  wo rdprocessor wp tex rtf various wordcprocessor  doc formats  library lib a so dll libraries o troutines for   programmers  print or view ps pdf jpg ascii or binary file in a  format for printing or  viewing  archive arc zip tar ·· related files grouped into   one file sometimes com  pressed for archiving  or storage  multimedia mpeg mov rm binary file containing  mp avi audio or a v information  figure common file types  end with a doc extension these extensions are not required so a user may  specify a file without the extension to save typing and the application will  look for a file with the given name and the extension it expects because these  extensions are not supported by the operating system they can be considered  as hints to the applications that operate on them  another example of the utility of file types comes from the tops  operating system if the user tries to execute an object program whose source file  has been modified or edited since the object file was produced the source file  will be recompiled automatically this function ensures that the user always  runs an up to date object file otherwise the user could waste a significant  amount of time executing the old object file for this function to be possible  the operating system must be able to discriminate the source file from the  object file to check the time that each file was created or last modified and  to determine the language of the source program in order to use the correct  compiler  consider too the mac os x operating system in this system each file has  a type such as text for text file or appl for application each file also has  a creator attribute containing the name of the program that created it this  attribute is set by the operating system during the create call so its use  is enforced and supported by the system for instance a file produced by a  word processor has the word processor s name as its creator when the user  opens that file by double clicking the mouse on the icon representing the file    the word processor is invoked automatically and the file is loaded ready to be  edited  the unix system uses a crude stored at the beginning of  some files to indicate roughly the type of the file executable program batch  file or postscript file and so on not all files have magic numbers  so system features cannot be based solely on this information unix does not  record the name of the creating program either unix does allow file name\\xad extension hints but these extensions are neither enforced nor depended on by  the operating system they are meant mostly to aid users in determining what  type of contents the file contains extensions can be used or ignored by a given  application but that is up to the application s programmer   file structure  file types also can be used to indicate the internal structure of the file as  mentioned in section  source and object files have structures that match  the expectations of the programs that read them further certain files must  conform to a required structure that is understood by the operating system for  example the operating system requires that an executable file have a specific  structure so that it can determine where in memory to load the file and what  the location of the first instruction is some operating systems extend this idea  into a set of system supported file structures with sets of special operations  for manipulating files with those structures for instance dec s vms operating  system has a file system that supports three defined file structures  this point brings us to one of the disadvantages of having the operating  system support multiple file structures the resulting size of the operating  system is cumbersome if the operating system defines five different file  structures it needs to contain the code to support these file structures  in addition it may be necessary to define every file as one of the file  types supported by the operating system when new applications require  information structured in ways not supported by the operating system severe  problems may result  for example assume that a system supports two types of files text files   composed of ascii characters separated by a carriage return and line feed  and executable binary files now if we as users want to define an encrypted  file to protect the contents from being read by unauthorized people we may  find neither file type to be appropriate the encrypted file is not ascii text lines  but rather is apparently random bits although it may appear to be a binary  file it is not executable as a result we may have to circumvent or misuse the  operating system s file type mechanism or abandon our encryption scheme  some operating systems impose and support a minimal number of file  structures this approach has been adopted in unix ms dos and others unx  considers each file to be a sequence of bit bytes no interpretation of these bits  is made by the operating systen l this scheme provides maximum flexibility  but little support each application program must include its own code to  interpret an input file as to the appropriate structure however all operating  systems must support at least one structure that of an executable file so  that the system is able to load and run programs  the macintosh operating system also supports a minimal number of  file structures it expects files to contain two parts a and a   chapter   the resource fork contains information of interest to the user  for instance it holds the labels of any buttons displayed by the program  a foreign user may want to re label these buttons in his own language and  the macintosh operating system provides tools to allow modification of the  data in the resource fork the data fork contains program code or data the  traditional file contents to accomplish the same task on a unix or ms dos  system the programmer would need to change and recompile the source code  unless she created her own user changeable data file clearly it is useful for  an operating system to support structures that will be used frequently and  that will save the programmer substantial effort too few structures make  programming inconvenient whereas too many cause operating system bloat  and programmer confusion   internal file structure  internally locating an offset within a file can be complicated for the operating  system disk systems typically have a well defined block size determined by  the size of a sector all disk i is performed in units of one block physical  record and all blocks are the same size it is unlikely that the physical record  size will exactly match the length of the desired logical record logical records  may even vary in length paddng a number of logical records into physical  blocks is a common solution to this problem  for example the unix operating system defines all files to be simply  streams of bytes each byte is individually addressable by its offset from the  begiming or end of the file in this case the logical record size is byte the  file system automatically packs and unpacks bytes into physical disk blocks\\xad say bytes per block as necessary  the logical record size physical block size and packing technique deter\\xad mine how many logical records are in each physical block the packing can be  done either by the user s application program or by the operating system in  either case the file may be considered a sequence of blocks all the basic i o  functions operate in terms of blocks the conversion from logical records to  physical blocks is a relatively simple software problem  because disk space is always allocated in blocks some portion of the last  block of each file is generally wasted if each block were bytes for example  then a file of bytes would be allocated four blocks bytes the last   bytes would be wasted the waste incurred to keep everything in units  of blocks instead of bytes is all file systems suffer  from internal fragmentation the larger the block size the greater the internal  fragmentation  files store information when it is used this information must be accessed and  read into computer memory the information in the file can be accessed in  several ways some systems provide only one access method for files other  systems such as those of ibm support many access methods and choosing the  right one for a particular application is a major design problem    beginning current position end      rewind read or write  figure sequential access file   sequential access  the simplest access method is information in the file is  processed in order one record after the other this mode of access is by far the  most common for example editors and compilers usually access files in this  fashion  reads and writes make up the bulk of the operations on a file a read  operation read next reads the next portion of the file and automatically  advances a file pointer which tracks the i o location similarly the write  operation write next appends to the end of the file and advances to the  end of the newly written material the new end of file such a file can be reset  to the beginning and on some systems a program may be able to skip forward  or backward n records for some integer n perhaps only for n  sequential  access which is depicted in figure is based on a tape model of a file and  works as well on sequential access devices as it does on random access ones   direct access   or a file is made up of fixed  length that allow programs to read and write records rapidly  in no particular order the direct access method is based on a disk model of  a file since disks allow random access to any file block for direct access the  file is viewed as a numbered sequence of blocks or records thus we may read  block then read block and then write block there are no restrictions  on the order of reading or writing for a direct access file  direct access files are of great use for immediate access to large amounts  of information databases are often of this type when a query concerning a  particular subject arrives we compute which block contains the answer and  then read that block directly to provide the desired information  as a simple example on an airline reservation system we might store all  the information about a particular flight for example flight in the block  identified by the flight number thus the number of available seats for flight   is stored in block of the reservation file to store ilformation about a  larger set such as people we might compute a hash function on the people s  names or search a small in ncemory index to determine a block to read and  search  for the direct access method the file operations must be modified to  include the block number as a parameter thus we have read n where n is  the block number rather than read next and ·write n rather than write next an  alternative approach is to retain read next and write next as with sequential   chapter  figure simulation of sequential access on a direct access file  access and to add an operation position file to n where n is the block number  then to effect a read n we would position to n and then read next  the block number by the user to the operating system is normally  a a relative block number is an index relative to the  begirm ing of the file thus the first relative block of the file is the next is   and so on even though the absolute disk address may be for the  first block and for the second the use of relative block numbers allows  the operating system to decide where the file should be placed called the  allocation problem as discussed in chapter and helps to prevent the user  from accessing portions of the file system that may not be part of her file some  systems start their relative block numbers at others start at  how then does the system satisfy a request for record nina file assuming  we have a logical record length l the request for record n is turned into an i  request for l bytes starting at location l n within the file assuming the first  record is n  since logical records are of a fixed size it is also easy to read  write or delete a record  not all operating systems support both sequential and direct access for  files some systems allow only sequential file access others allow only direct  access some systems require that a file be defined as sequential or direct when  it is created such a file can be accessed only in a manner consistent with its  declaration we can easily simulate sequential access on a direct access file by  simply keeping a variable cp that defines our current position as shown in  figure simulating a direct access file on a sequential access file however  is extremely inefficient and clumsy   other access methods  other access methods can be built on top of a direct access method these  methods generally involve the construction of an index for the file the  like an index in the back of a contains pointers to the various blocks to  find a record in the file we first search the index and then use the to  access the file directly and to find the desired record  for example a retail price file might list the universal codes upcs  items with the associated prices each record consists a digit upc and  a digit price a byte record if our disk has bytes per we  can store records per block a file of records would occupy about   blocks million bytes by keeping the file sorted by upc we can define  an index consisting of the first upc in each block this index would have  entries of digits each or bytes and thus could be kept in memory to  index file relative file  figure example of irdex and relative files  find the price of a particular item we can make a binary search of the index  from this search we learn exactly which block contains the desired record and  access that block this structure allows us to search a large file doing little i  with large files the index file itself may become too large to be kept in  memory one solution is to create an index for the index file the primary  index file would contain pointers to secondary index files which would point  to the actual data items  for example ibm s indexed sequential access method isam uses a small  master index that points to disk blocks of a secondary index the secondary  index blocks point to the actual file blocks the file is kept sorted on a defined  key to find a particular item we first make a binary search of the master index  which provides the block number of the secondary index this block is read  in and again a binary search is used to find the block containing the desired  record finally this block is searched sequentially in this way any record can  be located from its key by at most two direct access reads figure shows a  similar situation as implemented by vms index and relative files  next we consider how to store files certainly no general purpose computer  stores just one file there are typically thousand millions and even billions  of files within a computer files are stored on random access storage devices  including hard disks optical disks and solid state memory based disks  a storage device can be used in its entirety for a file system it can also be  subdivided for finer grained control for example a disk can be  into quarters and each quarter can hold a file system storage devices can also  be collected together into raid sets that provide protection from the failure of  a single disk as described in section  sometimes disks are subdivided  and also collected into raid sets  partitioning is useful for limiting the sizes of individual file systems  putting multiple file system types on the same device or leaving part of the  device available for other uses such as swap space or unformatted rz c v disk   chapter  directory directory  partition a files disk    ··· disk  directory partition c files  partition b files  disk  figure a typical file system organization  space partitions are also known as or in the ibm world a file  system can be created on each of these parts of the disk any entity containing  a file system is generally known as a the volume may be a subset  of a device a whole device or multiple devices linked together into a raid  set each volume can be thought of as a virtual disk volumes can also store  multiple operating systems allowing a system to boot and run more than one  operating system  each volume that contains a file system must also contain information  about the files in the system this information is kept in entries in a  or the device directory more commonly  known simply as that records information such as name location  size and type for all files on that volume figure shows a typical  file system organization   storage structure  as we have just seen a general purpose computer system has multiple storage  devices and those devices can be sliced up into volumes that hold file systems  computer systems may have zero or more file systems and the file systems  may be of varying types for example a typical solaris system may have dozens  of file systems of a dozen different types as shown in the file system list in  fig re  in this book we consider only general purpose file systems it is worth  noting though that there are many special purpose file systems consider the  types of file systems in the solaris example mentioned above  tmpfs a temporary file system that is created in volatile main memory  and has its contents erased if the system reboots or crashes  objfs a virtual file system essentially an interface to the kernel that  looks like a file system that gives debuggers access to kernel symbols  dfs a virtual file system that maintains contract information to manage  which

information on all processes as  a file system  ufs zfs general purpose file systems  the file systems of computers then can be extensive even within a file  system it is useful to segregate files into groups and manage and act on those  groups this organization involves the use of directories in the remainder of  this section we explore the topic of directory structure   directory overview  the directory can be viewed as a symbol table that translates file names into  their directory entries if we take such a view we see that the directory itself  can be organized in many ways we want to be able to insert entries to delete  entries to search for a named entry and to list all the entries in the directory  in this section we examine several schemes for defining the logical structure  of the directory system  when considering a particular directory structure we need to keep in mind  the operations that are to be performed on a directory  search for a file we need to be able to search a directory structure to find  the entry for a particular file since files have symbolic names and similar   chapter  names may indicate a relationship between files we may want to be able  to find all files whose names match a particular pattern  create a file new files need to be created and added to the directory  delete a file when a file is no longer needed we want to be able to remove  it from the directory  list a directory we need to be able to list the files in a directory and the  contents of the directory entry for each file in the list  rename a file because the name of a file represents its contents to its users  we must be able to change the name when the contents or use of the file  changes renaming a file may also allow its position within the directory  structure to be changed  traverse the file system we may wish to access every directory and every  file within a directory structure for reliability it is a good idea to save the  contents and structure of the entire file system at regular intervals often  we do this by copyin g all files to magn etic tape this technique provides a  backup copy in case of system failure in addition if a file is no longer in  use the file can be copied to tape and the disk space of that file released  for reuse by another file  in the following sections we describe the most common schemes for defining  the logical structure of a directory   single level directory  the simplest directory structure is the single level directory all files are  contained in the same directory which is easy to support and understand   figure   a single level directory has significant limitations however when the  number of files increases or when the system has more than one user since all  files are in the same directory they must have unique names if two users call  their data file test then the unique name rule is violated for example in one  programming class students called the program for their second assignment  prog another called it assign although file names are generally selected to  reflect the content of the file they are often limited in length complicating the  task of making file names unique the ms dos operating system allows only   character file names unix in contrast allows characters  even a single user on a single level directory may find it difficult to  remember the names of all the files as the number of files increases it is not  directory  files  figure single level directory    uncommon for a user to have hundreds of files on one computer system and an  equal number of additional files on another system keeping track of so many  files is a daunting task   two level directory  as we have seen a single level directory often leads to confusion of file names  among different users the standard solution is to create a separate directory  for each user  in the two level directory structure each user has his own  the ufds have similar structures but each lists only the files  of a single user wen a user job starts or a user logs in the system s  is searched the mfd is indexed by user name or account  number and each entry points to the ufd for that user figure   when a user refers to a particular file only his own ufd is searched thus  different users may have files with the same name as long as all the file names  within each ufd are unique to create a file for a user the operating system  searches only that user s ufd to ascertain whether another file of that name  exists to delete a file the operating system confines its search to the local ufd  thus it cannot accidentally delete another user s file that has the same name  the user directories themselves must be created and deleted as necessary  a special system program is run with the appropriate user name and account  information the program creates a new ufd and adds an entry for it to the mfd  the execution of this program might be restricted to system administrators the  allocation of disk space for user directories can be handled with the teduciques  discussed in chapter for files themselves  although the two level directory structure solves the name collision prob\\xad lem it still has disadvantages this structure effectively isolates one user from  another isolation is an advantage when the users are completely independent  but is a disadvantage when the users want to cooperate on some task and to  access one another s files some systems simply do not allow local user files to  be accessed by other users  if access is to be pennitted one user must have the ability to name a file  in another user s directory to name a particular file lmiquely in a two level  directory we must give both the user name and the file name a two level  directory can be thought of as a tree or an inverted tree of height the root  of the tree is the mfd its direct descendants are the ufds the descendants of  user file  directory  figure i two level directory structure   chapter  the ufds are the files themselves the files are the leaves of the tree specifying  a user name and a file name defines a path in the tree from the root the mfd  to a leaf the specified file thus a user name and a file name define a path  name every file in the system has a path name to name a file uniquely a user  must know the path name of the file desired  for example if user a wishes to access her own test file named test she can  simply refer to test to access the file named test of user b with directory entry  name userb however she might have to refer to userb test every system has  its own syntax for naming files in directories other than the user s own  additional syntax is needed to specify the volume of a file for instance  in ms dos a volume is specified by a letter followed by a colon thus a file  specification might be c userb fest some systems go even further and separate  the volume directory name and file name parts of the specification for  instance in vms the file login com might be specified as u sst jdeck login com l  where u is the name of the volume sst is the name of the directory jdeck is the  name of the subdirectory and is the version number other systems simply  treat the volume name as part of the directory name the first name given is  that of the volume and the rest is the directory and file for instance u pbg test  might specify volume u directory pbg and file test  a special case of this situation occurs with the system files programs pro\\xad vided as part of the system loaders assemblers compilers utility routines  libraries and so on are generally defined as files when the appropriate  commands are given to the operating system these files are read by the loader  and executed many command interpreters simply treat such a command as the  name of a file to load and execute as the directory system is defined presently  this file name would be searched for in the current ufd one solution would  be to copy the system files into each ufd however copying all the system files  would waste an enormous amount of space if the system files require mb  then supporting users would require x  mb just for copies of the  system files  the standard solution is to complicate the search procedure slightly a  special user directory is defined to contain the system files for example user   whenever a file name is given to be loaded the operating system first  searches the local ufd if the file is found it is used if it is not found the system  automatically searches the special user directory that contains the system files  the sequence of directories searched when a file is named is called the   the search path can be extended to contain an unlimited list of directories  to search when a command name is given this method is the one most used  in unix and ms dos systems can also be designed so that each user has his  own search path   tree structured directories  once we have seen how to view a two level directory as a two level tree  the natural generalization is to extend the directory structure to a tree of  arbitrary height figure  this generalization allows users to create their  own subdirectories and to organize their files accordingly a tree is the most  common directory structure the tree has a root directory and every file in the  system has a unique path name    figure i tree structured directory structure  a directory or subdirectory contains a set of files or subdirectories a  directory is simply another file but it is treated in a special way all directories  have the same internal format one bit in each directory entry defines the entry  as a file or as a subdirectory  special system calls are used to create and  delete directories  in normal use each process has a current directory the  should contain most of the files that are of current interest to the process  when reference is made to a file the current directory is searched if a file is  needed that is not in the current directory then the user usually must either  specify a path name or change the current directory to be the directory holding  that file to change directories a system call is provided that takes a directory  name as a parameter and uses it to redefine the current directory thus the  user can change his current directory whenever he desires from one change  directory system call to the next all open system calls search the current  directory for the specified file note that the search path may or may not  contain a special entry that stands for the current directory  the initial current directory of the login shell of a user is designated when  the user job starts or the user logs in the operating system searches the  accounting file or some other predefined location to find an entry for this  user for accounting purposes in the accounting file is a pointer to or the  name of the user s initial directory this pointer is copied to a local variable  for this user that specifies the user s initial current directory from that shell  other processes can be spawned the current directory of any subprocess is  usually the current directory of the parent when it was spawned  path names can be of two types absolute and relative an  begins at the root and follows a down to the specified file giving  the directory names on the path a defies a path from the  current directory for example in the tree structured file system of figure   chapter  if the current directory is root spell mail then the relative path nan e prt jirst  refers to the same file as does the absolute path name root spell mail prt jirst  allowing a user to define her own subdirectories permits her to impose  a structure on her files this structure might result in separate directories for  files associated with different topics for example a subdirectory was created  to hold the text of this book or different forms of information for example the  directory programs may contain source programs the directory bin may store  all the binaries  an interesting policy decision in a tree structured directory concerns how  to handle the deletion of a directory if a directory is empty its entry in the  directory that contains it can simply be deleted however suppose the directory  to be deleted is not ernpty but contains several files or subdirectories one of  two approaches can be taken some systems such as ms dos will not delete a  directory unless it is empty thus to delete a directory the user must first delete  all the files in that directory if any subdirectories exist this procedure must  be applied recursively to them so that they can be deleted also this approach  can result in a substantial amount of work an alternative approach such as  that taken by the unix rm command is to provide an option when a request is  made to delete a directory all that directory s files and subdirectories are also  to be deleted either approach is fairly easy to implement the choice is one  of policy the latter policy is more convenient but it is also more dangerous  because an entire directory structure can be removed with one command if  that command is issued in error a large number of files and directories will  need to be restored assuming a backup exists  with a tree structured directory system users can be allowed to access in  addition to their files the files of other users for example user b can access a  file of user a by specifying its path names user b can specify either an absolute  or a relative path name alternatively user b can change her current directory  to be user a s directory and access the file by its file names  a path to a file in a tree struchred directory can be longer than a path  in a two level directory to allow users to access programs without having to  remember these long paths the macintosh operating system automates the  search for executable programs one method it uses is to maintain a file called  the desktop file containing the metadata code and the name and location  of all executable programs it has seen when a new hard disk is added to the  system or the network is accessed the operating system traverses the directory  structure searching for executable programs on the device and recording the  pertinent information this mechanism supports the double dick execution  functionality described previously a double dick on a file causes its creator\\xad attribute data to be read and the desktop file to be searched for a match once  the match is found the appropriate executable program is started with the  clicked on file as its input   acyclic graph directories  consider two programmers who are working on a joint project the files asso\\xad ciated with that project can be stored in a subdirectory separating them from  other projects and files of the two programmers but since both programmers  are equally responsible for the project both want the subdirectory to be in   directory and disk structure  figure acyclic graph directory structure  their own directories the common subdirectory should be shared a shared  directory or file will exist in the file system in two or more places at once  a tree structure prohibits the sharing of files or directories an acyclic graph   that is a graph with no cycles allows directories to share subdirectories  and files figure  the same file or subdirectory may be in two different  directories the acyclic graph is a natural generalization of the tree structured  directory scheme  it is important to note that a shared file or directory is not the same as two  copies of the file with two copies each programmer can view the copy rather  than the original but if one programmer changes the file the changes will not  appear in the other s copy with a shared file only one actual file exists so any  changes made by one person are immediately visible to the other sharing is  particularly important for subdirectories a new file created by one person will  automatically appear in all the shared subdirectories  when people are working as a team all the files they want to share can be  put into one directory the ufd of each team member will contain this directory  of shared files as a subdirectory even in the case of a single user the user s file  organization may require that some file be placed in different subdirectories  for example a program written for a particular project should be both in the  directory of all programs and in the directory for that project  shared files and subdirectories can be implemented in several ways a  common way exemplified by many of the unix systems is to create a new  directory entry called a link a link is effectively a pointer to another file  or subdirectory for example a link may be implemented as an absolute or a  relative path name when a reference to a file is made we search the directory if  the directory entry is marked as a link then the name of the real file is included  in the link information we resolve the link by using that path name to locate  the real file links are easily identified by their format in the directory entry   or by having a special type on systems that support types and are effectively   chapter  indirect pointers the operating system ignores these links when traversing  directory trees to preserve the acyclic structure of the system  another common approach to implementing shared files is simply to  duplicate all information about them in both sharing directories thus both  entries are identical and equal consider the difference between this approach  and the creation of a link the link is clearly different from the original directory  entry thus the two are not equal duplicate directory entries however make  the original and the copy indistinguishable a major problem with duplicate  directory entries is maintaining consistency when a file is modified  an acyclic graph directory structure is more flexible than is a simple tree  structure but it is also more complex several problems must be considered  carefully a file may now have multiple absolute path names consequently  distinct file names may refer to the same file this situation is similar to the  aliasing problem for programming languages if we are trying to traverse the  entire file system to find a file to accumulate statistics on all files or to copy  all files to backup storage this problem becomes significant since we do not  want to traverse shared structures more than once  another problem involves deletion when can the space allocated to a  shared file be deallocated and reused one possibility is to remove the file  whenever anyone deletes it but this action may leave dangling pointers to the  now nonexistent file worse if the remaining file pointers contain actual disk  addresses and the space is subsequently reused for other files these dangling  pointers may point into the middle of other files  in a system where sharing is implemented by symbolic links this situation  is somewhat easier to handle the deletion of a link need not affect the original  file only the link is removed if the file entry itself is deleted the space for  the file is deallocated leaving the links dangling we can search for these links  and remove them as well but unless a list of the associated links is kept with  each file this search can be expensive alternatively we can leave the links  until an attempt is made to use them at that time we can determine that the  file of the name given by the link does not exist and can fail to resolve the  link name the access is treated just as with any other illegal file name in this  case the system designer should consider carefully what to do when a file is  deleted and another file of the same name is created before a symbolic link to  the original file is used in the case of unix symbolic links are left when a file  is deleted and it is up to the user to realize that the orig llcal file is gone or has  been replaced microsoft windows all flavors uses the same approach  another approach to deletion is to preserve the file until all references to  it are deleted to implement this approach we must have some mechanism  for determining that the last reference to the file has been deleted we could  keep a list of all references to a file directory entries or symbolic links when  a link or a copy of the directory entry is established a new entry is added to  the file reference list when a link or directory entry is deleted we remove its  entry on the list the file is deleted when its file reference list is empty  the trouble with this approach is the variable and potentially large size of  the file reference list however we really do not need to keep the entire list   we need to keep only a count of the number of references adding a new  link or directory entry increments the reference count deleting a link or entry  decrements the count when the count is the file can be deleted there are  no remaining references to it the unix operating system uses this approach    for nonsymbolic links or keeping a reference count in the file  information block or inode see appendix a  by effectively prohibiting  multiple references to directories we maintain an acyclic graph structure  to avoid problems such as the ones just discussed some systems do  not allow shared directories or links for example in ms dos the directory  structure is a tree structure rather than an acyclic graph   general graph directory  a serious problem with using an acyclic graph structure is ensuring that there  are no cycles if we start with a two level directory and allow users to create  subdirectories a tree structured directory results it should be fairly easy to see  that simply adding new files and subdirectories to an existing tree structured  directory preserves the tree structured nature however when we add links  the tree structure is destroyed resulting in a simple graph structure figure    the primary advantage of an acyclic graph is the relative simplicity of the  algorithms to traverse the graph and to determine when there are no more  references to a file we want to avoid traversing shared sections of an acyclic  graph twice mainly for performance reasons if we have just searched a major  shared subdirectory for a particular file without finding it we want to avoid  searching that subdirectory again the second search would be a waste of time  if cycles are allowed to exist in the directory we likewise want to  avoid searching any component twice for reasons of correctness as well as  performance a poorly designed algorithm might result in an infinite loop  continually searching through the cycle and never terminating one solution  is to limit arbitrarily the number of directories that will be accessed during a  search  a similar problem exists when we are trying to determine when a file  can be deleted with acyclic graph directory structures a value of in the  reference count means that there are no more references to the file or directory  figure general graph directory   chapter   and the file can be deleted however when cycles exist the reference count  may not be even when it is no longer possible to refer to a directory or file  this anomaly results from the possibility of self referencing or a cycle in the  directory structure in this case we generally need to use a garbage collection  scheme to determine when the last reference has been deleted and the disk  space can be reallocated garbage collection involves traversing the entire file  system marking everything that can be accessed then a second pass collects  everything that is not marked onto a list of free space a similar marking  procedure can be used to ensure that a traversal or search will cover everything  in the file system once and only once garbage collection for a disk based file  system however is extremely time consuming and is thus seldom attempted  garbage collection is necessary only because of possible cycles in the graph  thus an acyclic graph structure is much easier to work with the difficulty  is to avoid cycles as new links are added to the structure how do we know  when a new lirk will complete a cycle there are algorithms to detect cycles  in graphs however they are computationally expensive especially when the  graph is on disk storage a simpler algorithm in the special case of directories  and links is to bypass links during directory traversal cycles are avoided and  no extra overhead is incurred  just as a file must be opened before it is used a file system must be mounted before  it can be available to processes on the system more specifically the directory  structure may be built out of multiple volumes which must be mounted to  make them available within the file system name space  the mount procedure is straightforward the operating system is given the  name of the device and the location within the file structure  where the file system is to be attached some operating systems require that a  file system type be provided while others inspect the structures of the device  and determine the type of file system typically a mount point is an empty  directory for instance on a unix system a file system containing a user s home  directories might be mounted as home then to access the directory structure  within that file system we could precede the directory names with home as  in home jane motmting that file system under users would result in the path  name users jane which we could use to reach the same directory  next the operating system verifies that the device contains a valid file  system it does so by asking the device driver to read the device directory  and verifying that the directory has the expected format finally the operating  system notes in its directory structure that a file system is n ounted at the  specified mount point this scheme enables the operating system to traverse  its directory structure switching among file systems and even file systems of  varying types as appropriate  to illustrate file mounting consider the file system depicted in figure   where the triangles represent subtrees of directories that are of interest  figure a shows an existing file system while figure b shows an  unmounted volume residing on device ds c at this point only the files on the  existing file system can be accessed figure shows the effects of mounting   file system mounting  bill   a b  figure file system a existing system b unmounted volume  the volume residing on device dsk over users if the volume is unmounted the  file system is restored to the situation depicted in figure  systems impose semantics to clarify functionality for example a system  may disallow a mount over a directory that contains files or it may make the  mounted file system available at that directory and obscure the directory s  existing files until the file system is unmounted terminating the use of the file  system and allowing access to the original files in that directory as another  example a system may allow the same file system to be mounted repeatedly  at different mount points or it may only allow one mount per file system  consider the actions of the classic macintosh operating system whenever  the system encounters a disk for the first time hard disks are found at boot  time and optical disks are seen when they are inserted into the drive the  macintosh operating system searches for a file system on the device if it finds  one it automatically mounts the file system at the root level adding a folder  icon on the screen labeled with the name of the file system as stored in the  i  figure mount point   chapter   device directory the user is then able to click on the icon and thus display the  newly mounted file system mac os x behaves much like bsd unix on which it  is based all file systems are mounted under the volumes directory the mac  os x gui hides this fact and shows the file systems as if they were all mounted  at the root level  the microsoft windows family of operating systems  nt small   xp vista maintains an extended two level directory structure  with devices and volumes assigned drive letters volumes have a general graph  directory structure associated with the drive letter the path to a specific file  takes the form of drive letter path to file the more recent versions of windows  allow a file system to be mounted anywhere in the directory tree just as  unix does windows operating systems automatically discover all devices and  mount all located file systems at boot time in some systems like unix the  mount commands are explicit a system configuration file contains a list of  devices and mount points for automatic mounting at boot time but other  mounts may be executed manually  issues concerning file system mounting are further discussed in section   and in appendix a  in the previous sections we explored the motivation for file sharing and some of  the difficulties involved in allowing users to share files such file sharing is very  desirable for users who want to collaborate and to reduce the effort required  to achieve a computing goal therefore user oriented operating systems must  accommodate the need to share files in spite of the inherent difficulties  in this section we examine more aspects of file sharing we begin by  discussing general issues that arise when multiple users share files once  multiple users are allowed to share files the challenge is to extend sharing to  multiple file systems including remote file systems we discuss that challenge  as well finally we consider what to do about conflicting actions occurring on  shared files for instance if multiple users are writing to a file should all the  writes be allowed to occurf or should the operating system protect the users  actions from one another   multiple users  when an operating system accommodates multiple users the issues of file  sharing file naming and file protection become preeminent given a directory  structure that allows files to be shared by users the system must mediate the  file sharing the system can either allow a user to access the files of other users  by default or require that a user specifically grant access to the files these are  the issues of access control and protection which are covered in section  to implement sharing and protection the system must maintain more file  and directory attributes than are needed on a single user system although  many approaches have been taken to meet this requirement most systems  have evolved to use the concepts of file or directory owner or user and group  the owner is the user who can change attributes and grant access and who has  the most control over the file the group attribute defines a subset of users who    can share access to the file for example the owner of a file on a unix system  can issue all operations on a file while members of the file s group can execute  one subset of those operations and all other users can execute another subset  of operations exactly which operations can be executed by group members  and other users is definable by the file s owner more details on permission  attributes are included in the next section  the owner and group ids of a given file or directory are stored with the  other file attributes when a user requests an operation on a file the user id can  be compared with the owner attribute to determine if the requesting user is the  owner of the file likewise the group ids can be compared the result indicates  which permissions are applicable the system then applies those permissions  to the requested operation and allows or denies it  many systems have multiple local file systems including volumes of a  single disk or multiple volumes on multiple attached disks in these cases  the id checking and permission matching are straightforward once the file  systems are mounted   remote file systems  with the advent of networks chapter communication among remote  computers became possible networking allows the sharing of resources spread  across a campus or even around the world one obvious resource to share is  data in the form of files  through the evolution of network and file technology remote file sharing  methods have changed the first implemented method involves manually  transferring files between machines via programs like ftp the second major  method uses a dfs in which remote directories are  visible from a local machine in some ways the third method the  is a reversion to the first a browser is needed to gain access to the  remote files and separate operations essentially a wrapper for ftp are used  to transfer files  ftp is used for both anonymous and authenticated access  allows a user to transfer files without having an account on the remote  system the world wide web uses anonymous file exchange almost exclusively  dfs involves a much tighter integration between the machine that is accessing  the remote files and the machine providing the files this integration adds  complexity which we describe in this section   the client server model  remote file systems allow a computer to mom t one or more file systems  from one or more remote machines in this case the machine containing the  files is the server and the machine seeking access to the files is the client the  client server relationship is common with networked machines generally  the server declares that a resource is available to clients and specifies exactly  which resource in this case which files and exactly which clients a server  can serve multiple clients and a client can use multiple servers depending on  the implementation details of a given client server facility  the server usually specifies the available files on a volume or directory  level client identification is more difficult a client can be specified  network name or other identifier such as an ip address but these can be   chapter  or imitated as a result of spoofing an unauthorized client could be allowed  access to the server more secure solutions include secure authentication of the  client via encrypted keys unfortunately with security come many challenges  including ensuring compatibility of the client and server they must use the  same encryption algorithms and security of key exchanges intercepted keys  could again allow unauthorized access because of the difficulty of solving  these problems unsecure authentication methods are most commonly used  in the case of unix and its network file system nfs authentication takes  place via the client networking information by default in this scheme the  user s ids on the client and server must match lf they do not the server will  be unable to determine access rights to files consider the example of a user  who has an id of on the client and on the server a request from  the client to the server for a specific file will not be handled appropriately as  the server will determine if user has access to the file rather than basing  the determination on the real user id of access is thus granted or denied  based on incorrect authentication information the server must trust the client  to present the correct user id note that the nfs protocols allow many to many  relationships that is many servers can provide files to many clients in fact  a given machine can be both a server to some nfs clients and a client of other  nfs servers  once the remote file system is mounted file operation requests are sent  on behalf of the user across the network to the server via the dfs protocol  typically a file open request is sent along with the id of the requesting user  the server then applies the standard access checks to determine if the user has  credentials to access the file in the mode requested the request is either allowed  or denied if it is allowed a file handle is returned to the client application  and the application then can perform read write and other operations on the  file the client closes the file when access is completed the operating system  may apply semantics similar to those for a local file system mount or may use  different semantics   distributed information systems  to make client server systems easier to manage  also known as provide unified access  to the information needed for remote computing the  provides host name to network address translations for the entire  internet including the world wide web before dns became widespread  files containing the same information were sent via e mail or ftp between all  networked hosts this methodology was not scalable dns is further discussed  in section   other distributed information systems provide user name password user  id group id space for a distributed facility unix systems have employed a wide  variety of distributed information methods sun microsystems introduced  yellow pages since renamed or and most of  the industry adopted its use it centralizes storage of user names host names  printer information and the like unfortunately it uses unsecure authentication  methods including sending user passwords unencrypted in clear text and  identifying hosts by ip address sun s nis is a much more secure replacement  for nis but is also much more complicated and has not been widely adopted    network  information is used in conjunction with user authentication user name and  password to create a that the server uses to decide whether  to allow or deny access to a requested file system for this authentication  to be valid the user names m u st match from machine to machine as with  nfs microsoft uses two distributed naming structures to provide a single  name space for users the older naming technology is the newer  technology available in windows xp and windows is  once established the distributed naming facility is used by all clients  servers to authenticate users  the industry is moving toward use of the  as a secure distributed naming mechanism in fact active  is based on ldap sun microsystems includes ldap with the  operating system and allows it to be employed for user authentication as  well as system wide retrieval of information such as availability of printers  conceivably one distributed ldap directory could be used by an organization  to store all user and resource information for all the organization s computers  the result would be for users who would enter  their authentication information once for access to all computers within the  organization it would also ease system administration efforts by combining  in one location information that is currently scattered in various files on each  system or in different distributed information services   failure modes  local file systems can fail for a variety of reasons including failure of the  disk containing the file system corruption of the directory structure or other  disk management information collectively called disk controller  failure cable failure and host adapter failure user or system administrator  failure can also cause files to be lost or entire directories or volumes to be  deleted many of these failures will cause a host to crash and an error condition  to be displayed and human intervention will be required to repair the damage  remote file systems have even more failure modes because of the  complexity of network systems and the required interactions between remote  machines many more problems can interfere with the proper operation of  remote file systems in the case of networks the network can be interrupted  between two hosts such interruptions can result from hardware failure poor  hardware configuration or networking implementation issues although some  networks have built in resiliency including multiple paths between hosts  many do not any single failure can thus interrupt the flow of dfs commands  consider a client in the midst of using a remote file system it has files open  from the remote host among other activities it may be performing directory  lookups to open files reading or writing data to files and closing files now  consider a partitioning of the network a crash of the server or even a scheduled  shutdown of the server suddenly the remote file system is no longer reachable  this scenario is rather common so it would not be appropriate for the client  system to act as it would if a local file system were lost rather the system can  either terminate all operations to the lost server or delay operations until the  server is again reachable these failure semantics are defined and in plemented  as part of the remote file system protocol termination of all operations can   chapter  result in users losing data and patience thus most dfs protocols either  enforce or allow delaying of file system operations to rencote hosts with the  hope that the remote host will become available again  to implement this kind of recovery from failure some kind of  may be maintained on both the client and the server if both server  and client maintain knowledge of their current activities and open files then  they can seamlessly recover from a failure in the situation where the server  crashes but must recognize that it has remotely rnounted exported file systems  and opened files nfs takes a simple approach implementing a dfs  in essence it assumes that a client request for a file read or write would not  have occurred unless the file system had been remotely mounted and the file  had been previously open the nfs protocol carries all the information needed  to locate the appropriate file and perform the requested operation similarly  it does not track which clients have the exported volumes mounted again  assuming that if a request comes in it must be legitimate while this stateless  approach makes nfs resilient and rather easy to implement it also makes it  unsecure for example forged read or write requests could be allowed by an  nfs server even though the requisite mount request and permission check  had not taken place these issues are addressed in the industry standard nfs  version in which nfs is made stateful to improve its security performance  and functionality   consistency semantics  represent an important criterion for evaluating any  file system that supports file sharing these semantics specify how multiple  users of a system are to access a shared file simultaneously in particular they  specify when modifications of data by one user will be observable by other  users these semantics are typically implemented as code with the file system  consistency semantics are directly related to the process synchronization  algorithms of chapter however the complex algorithms of that chapter tend  not to be implemented in the case of file i because of the great latencies and  slow transfer rates of disks and networks for example performing an atomic  transaction to a remote disk could involve several network communications  several disk reads and writes or both systems that attempt such a full set of  functionalities tend to perform poorly a successful implementation of complex  sharing semantics can be found in the andrew file system  for the following discussion we assume that a series of file accesses that  is reads and writes attempted by a user to the same file is always enclosed  between the open and close operations the series of accesses between  the open and close operations makes up a to illustrate the  concept we sketch several prominent examples of consistency semantics   unix semantics  the unix file system chapter uses the following consistency semantics  writes to an open file by a user are visible immediately to other users who  have this file open  one mode of sharing allows users to share the pointer of current location  into the file thus the advancing of the pointer by one user affects all     sharing users here a file has a single image that interleaves all accesses  regardless of their origin  in the unix semantics a file is associated with a single physical image that  is accessed as an exclusive resource contention for this single image causes  delays in user processes   session semantics  the andrew file system afs chapter uses the following consistency  semantics  writes to an open file by a user are not visible immediately to other users  that have the same file open  once a file is closed the changes made to it are visible only in sessions  starting later already open instances of the file do not reflect these changes  according to these semantics a file may be associated temporarily with several   possibly different images at the same time consequently multiple users are  allowed to perform both read and write accesses concurrently on their images  of the file without delay almost no constraints are enforced on scheduling  accesses   immutable shared files semantics  a unique approach is that of once a file is declared  as shared by its creator it camot be modified an immutable £ile has two key  properties its name may not be reused and its contents may not be altered  thus the name of an immutable file signifies that the contents of the file are  fixed the implementation of these semantics in a distributed system chapter   is simple because the sharing is disciplined read only  when information is stored in a computer system we want to keep it safe  from physical damage the issue of reliability and improper access the issue  of protection  reliability is generally provided by duplicate copies of files many comput\\xad ers have systems programs that automatically or through computer operator  intervention copy disk files to tape at regular intervals once per day or week  or month to maintain a copy should a file system be accidentally destroyed  file systems can be damaged by hardware problems such as errors in reading  or writing power surges or failures head crashes dirt temperature extremes  and vandalism files may be deleted accidentally bugs in the file system soft\\xad ware can also cause file contents to be lost reliability is covered in more detail  in chapter  protection can be provided in many ways for a small single user system  we might provide protection by physically removing the floppy disks and  locking them in a desk drawer or file cabinet in a multiuser system however  other mechanisms are needed   chapter   types of access  the need to protect files is a direct result of the ability to access files systems  that do not permit access to the files of other users do not need protection thus  we could provide complete protection by prohibiting access alternatively we  could provide free access with no protection both approaches are too extreme  for general use what is needed is  protection mechanisms provide controlled access by limitin g the types of  file access that can be made access is permitted or denied depending on  several factors one of which is the type of access requested several different  types of operations may be controlled  read read from the file  write write or rewrite the file  execute load the file into memory and execute it  append write new information at the end of the file  delete delete the file and free its space for possible reuse  list list the name and attributes of the file  other operations such as renaming copying and editing the file may also  be controlled for many systems however these higher level fmctions may  be implemented by a system program that makes lower level system calls  protection is provided at only the lower level for instance copying a file may  be implemented simply by a sequence of read requests in this case a user with  read access can also cause the file to be copied printed and so on  many protection mechanisms have been proposed each has advantages  and disadvantages and must be appropriate for its intended application a  small computer system that is used by only a few members of a research group  for example may not need the same types of protection as a large corporate  computer that is used for research finance and personnel operations we  discuss some approaches to protection in the following sections and present a  more complete treatment in chapter   access control  the most common approach to the protection problem is to make access  dependent on the identity of the user different users may need different types  of access to a file or directory the most general scheme to implement  dependent access is to associate with each file and directory an   acju specifying user names and the types of access allowed for each user  when a user requests access to a particular file the operating system checks  the access list associated with that file if that user is listed for the requested  access the access is allowed otherwise a protection violation occurs and the  user job is denied access to the file  this approach has the advantage of enabling complex access methodolo\\xad gies the main problem with access lists is their length if we want to allow  everyone to read a file we must list all users with read access this technique  has two undesirable consequences    constructing such a list may be a tedious and unrewarding task especially  if we do not know in advance the list of users in the system  the directory entry previously of fixed size now must be of variable size  resulting in more complicated space management  these problems can be resolved by use of a condensed version of the access  list  to condense the length of the access control list many systems recognize  three classifications of users in connection with each file  owner the user who created the file is the owner  group a set of users who are sharing the file and need similar access is a  group or work group  universe all other users in the system constitute the universe  the most common recent approach is to combine access control lists with  the more general and easier to implement owner group and universe access\\xad control scheme just described for example solaris and beyond use the  three categories of access by default but allow access control lists to be added  to specific files and directories when more fine grained access control is desired  to illustrate consider a person sara who is writing a new book she has  hired three graduate students jim dawn and jill to help with the project  the text of the book is kept in a file named book the protection associated with  this file is as follows  sara should be able to invoke all operations on the file  jim dawn and jill should be able only to read and write the file they  should not be allowed to delete the file  all other users should be able to read but not write the file sara is  interested in letting as many people as possible read the text so that she  can obtain feedback  to achieve such protection we must create a new group say text\\xad with members jim dawn and jill the name of the group text must then  be associated with the file book and the access rights must be set in accordance  with the policy we have outlined  now consider a visitor to whom sara would like to grant temporary access  to chapter the visitor cannot be added to the text group because that would  give him access to all chapters because a file can only be in one group sara  cannot add another group to chapter nith the addition of access control list  functionality though the visitor can be added to the access control list of  chapter  for this scheme to work properly permissions and access lists must be  controlled tightly this control can be accomplished in several ways for  example in the unix system groups can be created and modified only by  the manager of the facility or by any superuser thus control is achieved  through human interaction in the vms system the owner of the file can create   chapter  and modify the access control list access lists are discussed further in section    with the more limited protection classification only three fields are needed  to define protection often each field is a collection of bits and each bit either  allows or prevents the access associated with it for example the unix system  defines three fields of bits each rwx where r controls read access w controls  write access and x controls execution a separate field is kept for the file owner  for the file s group and for all other users in this scheme bits per file are  needed to record protection information thus for our example the protection  fields for the file book are as follows for the owner sara all bits are set for the  group text the rand w bits are set and for the universe only the r bit is set  one difficulty in combining approaches comes in the user interface users  must be able to tell when the optional acl permissions are set on a file in the  solaris example a appends the regular permissions as in  windows xp users typically manage access control lists via the cui figure   shows a file permission window on windows xp s ntfs file system in  this example user guest is specifically denied access to the file lo tex  another difficulty is assigning precedence when permission and acls  conflict for example if joe is in a file s group which has read permission  but the file has an acl granting joe read and write permission should a write  by joe be granted or denied solaris gives acls precedence as they are more  fine grained and are not assigned by default this follows the general rule that  specificity should have priority   other protection approaches  another approach to the protection problem is to associate a password with  each file just as access to the computer system is often controlled by a  password access to each file can be controlled in the same way if the passwords  are chosen randomly and changed often this scheme may be effective in  limiting access to a file the use of passwords has a few disadvantages  however first the number of passwords that a user needs to remember may  permissions in a unix system  in the unix system directory protection and file protection are handled  similarly associated with each subdirectory are three fields owner group  and universe each consisting of the three bits rwx thus a user can list  the content of a subdirectory only if the r bit is set in the appropriate field  similarly a user can change his current directory to another current directory   say faa only if the x bit associated with the faa subdirectory is set in the  appropriate field  a sample directory listing from a unix environment is shown in figure   the first field describes the protecti on of the file or directory ad as the  first character indicates a sbdirectory also shown are the number of links to  the file the owner s name the group s name the size of the file in bytes the  date of last modification and finally the file s name with optional extension   chapter   become large making the scheme impractical second if only one password is  used for all the files then once it is discovered all files are accessible protection  is on an all or none basis some systems for example tops allow a user  to associate a password with a subdirectory rather than with an individual  file to deal with this problem the ibmvm cms operating system allows three  passwords for a minidisk one each for read write and nrultiwrite access  some single user operating systencs such as ms dos and versions of the  macintosh operating system prior to mac os x provide little in terms of file  protection in scenarios where these older systems are now being placed on  networks file sharing and communication protection mechanisms  must be into them designing a feature for a new operating system  is almost always easier than adding a feature to an existing one such updates  are usually less effective and are not seamless  in a multilevel directory structure we need to protect not only individual  files but also collections of files in subdirectories that is we need to provide  a mechanism for directory protection the directory operations that must be  protected are somewhat different from the file operations we want to control  the creation and deletion of files in a directory in addition we probably want  to control whether a user can determine the existence of a file in a directory  sometimes knowledge of the existence and name of a file is significant in itself  thus listing the contents of a directory must be a protected operation similarly  if a path name refers to a file in a directory the user must be allowed access  to both the directory and the file in systems where files may have numerous  path names such as acyclic or general graphs a given user may have different  access rights to a particular file depending on the path name used  a file is an abstract data type defined and implemented by the operating  system it is a sequence of logical records a logical record may be a byte a line   of fixed or variable length or a more complex data item the operating system  may specifically support various record types or may leave that support to the  application program  the major task for the operating system is to map the logical file concept  onto physical storage devices such as magnetic tape or disk since the physical  record size of the device may not be the same as the logical record size it may  be necessary to order logical records into physical records again this task may  be supported by the operating system or left for the application program  each device in a file system keeps a volume table of contents or a device  directory listing the location of the files on the device in addition it is useful  to create directories to allow files to be organized a single level directory  in a multiuser system causes naming problems since each must have a  unique name a two level directory solves this creating a separate  directory for each users files the directory lists name and includes  the file s location on the disk length type owner time creation time of last  use and so on  the natural generalization of a two level directory is a tree structured  directory a tree structured directory allows a user to create subdirectories  to organize files acyclic graph directory structures enable users to share    subdirectories and files but complicate searching and deletion a general graph  structure allows complete flexibility in the sharing of files and directories but  sometimes requires garbage collection to recover unused disk space  disks are segmented into one or more volumes each containing a  file system or left raw file systems may be mounted into the system s  naming structures to make them available the naming scheme varies by  operating system once mounted the files within the volume are available  for use file systems may be unmounted to disable access or for maintenance  file sharing depends on the semantics provided by the system files may  have multiple readers multiple writers or limits on sharing distributed file  systems allow client hosts to mount volumes or directories from servers as long  as they can access each other across a network remote file systems present  challenges in reliability performance and security distributed information  systems maintain user host and access information so that clients and servers  can share state information to ncanage use and access  since files are the main information storage mechanism in most computer  systems file protection is needed access to files can be controlled separately  for each type of access read write execute append delete list directory  and so on file protection can be provided by access lists passwords or other  techniques   some systems provide file sharing by maintaining a single copy of a  file other systems maintain several copies one for each of the users  sharing the file discuss the relative merits of each approach   some systems automatically open a file when it is referenced for the first  time and close the file when the job terminates discuss the advantages  and disadvantages of this scheme compared with the more traditional  one where the user has to open and close the file explicitly   in some systems a subdirectory can be read and written by an  authorized user just as ordinary files can be  a describe the protection problems that could arise  b suggest a scheme for dealing with each of these protection  problems   do some systems keep track of the type of a file while others leave  it to the user and others simply do not implement multiple file types  which system is better   consider a system that supports users suppose that you want to  allow of these users to be able to access one file  a howwould specify this protection scheme in unix  b can you suggest another protection scheme that can be used more  effectively for this purpose than the scheme provided by unix   chapter   what are the advantages and disadvantages of providing ncandatory  locks instead of advisory locks whose usage is left to users discretion   explain the purpose of the open and close operations   the open file table is used to maintain information about files that are  currently open should the operating system maintain a separate table  for each user or just maintain one table that contains references to files  that are currently being accessed by all users if the same file is being  accessed by two different programs or users should there be separate  entries in the open file table   give an example of an application that could benefit from operating\\xad system support for random access to indexed files   discuss the advantages and disadvantages of associating with remote  file systems stored on file servers a set of failure semantics different  from that associated with local file systems   could you simulate a multilevel directory structure with a single level  directory structure in which arbitrarily long names can be used if your  answer is yes explain how you can do so and contrast this scheme with  the multilevel directory scheme if your answer is no explain what  prevents your simulation s success how would your answer change  if file names were limited to seven characters   what are the implications of supporting unix consistency semantics  for shared access for files stored on remote file systems   if the operating system knew that a certain application was going  to access file data in a sequential manner how could it exploit this  information to improve performance   consider a file system in which a file can be deleted and its disk space  reclaimed while links to that file still exist what problems may occur if  a new file is created in the same storage area or with the same absolute  path name how can these problems be avoided   discuss the advantages and disadvantages of supporting links to files  that cross mount points that is the file link refers to a file that is stored  in a different volume   what are the advantages and disadvantages of recording the name  of the creating program with the file s attributes as is done in the  macintosh operating system  general discussions concerning file systems are offered by grosshans   golden and pechura describe the structure of microcomputer file  systems database systems and their file structures are described in full in  silberschatz et al   a multilevel directory structure was first implemented on the multics

extensions to let dns hold security keys  ldap also known as x is a derivative subset of the x soo distributed  directory protocol it was defined by yeong et al  and has been  implemented on many operating systems  interesting research is ongoing in the area of file system interfaces in  particular on issues relating to file naming and attributes for example the  plan operating system from bell laboratories lucent technology makes all  objects look like file systems thus to display a list of processes on a system  a user simply lists the contents of the proc directory similarly to display the  time of day a user need only type the file i dev i time    c  as we saw in chapter the file system provides the mechanism for on line  storage and access to file contents including data and programs the file system  resides permanently on secondary storage which is designed to hold a large  amount of data permanently this chapter is primarily concerned with issues  surrounding file storage and access on the most common secondary storage  medium the disk we explore ways to structure file use to allocate disk space  to recover freed space to track the locations of data and to interface other  parts of the operating system to secondary storage performance issues are  considered throughout the chapter  to describe the details of implementing local file systems and directory  structures  to describe the implementation of remote file systems  to discuss block allocation and free block algorithms and trade offs  disks provide the bulk of secondary storage on which a file system is  maintained they have two characteristics that make them a convenient  medium for storing multiple files  a disk can be rewritten in place it is possible to read a block from the  disk modify the block and write it back into the sance place  a disk can access directly any block of information it contains thus it is  simple to access any file either sequentially or randomly and switching  from one file to another requires only moving the read write heads and  waiting for the disk to rotate  we discuss disk structure in great detail in chapter     chapter  to improve i efficiency i transfers between memory and disk are  performed in units of blocks each block has one or more sectors depending  on the disk drive sector size varies from bytes to bytes the usual size  is bytes  provide efficient and convenient access to the disk by allowing  data to be stored located and retrieved easily a file system poses two quite  different design problems the first problem is defining how the file system  should look to the user this task involves defining a file and its attributes  the operations allowed on a file and the directory structure for organizing  files the second problem is creating algorithms and data structures to map the  logical file system onto the physical secondary storage devices  the file system itself is generally composed of many different levels the  structure shown in figure is an example of a layered design each level in  the design uses the features of lower levels to create new features for use by  higher levels  the lowest level the i o control consists of and interrupt  handlers to transfer information between the main memory and the disk  system a device driver can be thought of as a translator its input consists of  high level commands such as retrieve block its output consists of low\\xad level hardware specific instructions that are used by the hardware controller  which interfaces the i device to the rest of the system the device driver  usually writes specific bit patterns to special locations in the i controller s  memory to tell the controller which device location to act on and what actions  to take the details of device drivers and the i o infrastructure are covered in  chapter  the needs only to issue generic commands to the  appropriate device driver to read and write physical blocks on the disk each  physical block is identified by its numeric disk address for example drive  cylilcder track sector this layer also manages the memory buffers  and caches that hold various file system directory

to hold  frequently used file system metadata to improve performance so managing  their contents is critical for optimum system performance  the knows about files and their logical blocks  as well as physical blocks by knowing the type of file allocation used and  the location of the file the file organization module can translate logical block  addresses to physical block addresses for the basic file system to transfer  each file s logical blocks are numbered from or through n since the  physical blocks containing the data usually do not match the logical numbers  a translation is needed to locate each block the file organization module also  includes the free space manager which tracks unallocated blocks and provides  these blocks to the file organization module when requested  finally the f je manages metadata information metadata  includes all of the file system structure except the actual data or contents of the  files the logical file system manages the directory structure to provide the file\\xad organization module with the information the latter needs given a symbolic  file name it maintains file structure via file control blocks a flle corttml   an in most unix file systems contains information about the  file including ownership permissions and location of the file contents the  logical file system is also responsible for protection and security as discussed  in chapters and  when a layered structure is used for file system implementation duplica\\xad tion of code is minimized the i o control and sometimes the basic file system  code can be used by multiple file systems each file system can then have its  own logical file system and file organization modules unfortunately layering  can introduce more operating system overhead which may result in decreased  performance the use of layering including the decision about how many  layers to use and what each layer should do is a major challenge in designing  new systems  many file systems are in use today most operating systems support  more than one for example most cd roms are written in the iso  format a standard format agreed on by cd rom manufacturers in addition  to removable media file systems each operating system has one or more disk\\xad based file systems unix uses the fee which is based on  the berkeley fast file system ffs windows nt and xp support disk  file system formats of fat fat and ntfs or windows nt file system as  well as cd rom dvd and floppy disk file system formats although linux  supports over forty different file systerns the standard linux file system is  known as the with the most common versions being  ext and ext there are also distributed file systems in which a file system on  a server is mounted by one or more client computers across a network  file system research continues to be an active area of operating system  design and implementation coogle created its own file system to meet the  company s specific storage and retrieval needs another interesting project  is the fuse file system which provides flexibility in file system use by  implementing and executing file systems as user level rather than kernel level  code using fuse a user can add a new file system to a variety of operating  systems and can use that file system to manage her files   chapter    as was described in section  operating systems implement open  and close systems calls for processes to request access to file contents  in this section we delve into the structures and operations used to implement  file system operations   overview  several on disk and in memory structures are used to implement a file system  these structures vary depending on the operating system and the file system  but some general principles apply  on disk the file system may contain information about how to boot an  operating system stored there the total number of blocks the number and  location of free blocks the directory structure and individual files many of  these structures are detailed throughout the remainder of this chapter here  we describe them briefly  a per volume can contain information needed by the  system to boot an operating system from that volume if the disk does not  contain an operating system this block can be empty it is typically the  first block of a volume in ufs it is called the b jsck in ntfs it is the   per volume contains volume or partition  details such as the number of blocks in the partition the size of the blocks  a free block count and free block pointers and a free fcb count and fcb  pointers in ufs this is called a in ntfs it is stored in the  a directory structure per file system is used to organize the files in ufs  this includes file names and associated inode numbers in ntfs it is stored  in the master file table  a per file fcb contains many details about the file it has a unique  identifier number to allow association with a directory entry in ntfs  this information is actually stored within the master file table which uses  a relational database structure with a row per file  the in memory in formation is used for both file system management and  performance improvement via caching the data are loaded at mount time  updated during file system operations and discarded at dismount several  types of structures may be included  an in memory  volume contains information about each mounted  an in memory directory structure cache holds the directory information  of recently accessed directories for directories at which volumes are  mounted it can contain a pointer to the volume table  the contains a copy of the fcb of each open  file as well as other information    file dates create access write  file owner group acl  file data blocks or pointers to file data blocks  figure a typical file control block  the contains a pointer to the appropriate entry  in the system wide open file table as well as other information  buffers hold file system blocks when they are being read from disk or  written to disk  to create a new file an application program calls the logical file system  the logical file system knows the format of the directory structures to create a  new file it allocates a new fcb alternatively if the file system implementation  creates all fcbs at file system creation time an fcb is allocated from the set  of free fcbs the system then reads the appropriate directory into memory  updates it with the new file name and fcb and writes it back to the disk a  typical fcb is shown in figure  some operating systems including unix treat a directory exactly the same  as a file one with a type field indicating that it is a directory other operating  systems includii g windows nt implement separate system calls for files and  directories and treat directories as entities separate from files whatever the  larger structural issues the logical file system can call the file organization  module to map the directory i into disk block numbers which are passed  on to the basic file system and i o control system  now that a file has been created it can be used for i first though it  must be opened the open call passes a file name to the logical file system  the open system call first searches the system wide open file table to see  if the file is already in use by another process if it is a per process open file  table entry is created pointing to the existing system wide open file table this  algorithm can save substantial overhead if the file is not already open the  directory structure is searched for the given file name parts of the directory  structure are usually cached in memory to speed directory operations once  the file is found the fcb is copied into a system wide open file table in memory  this table not only stores the fcb but also tracks the number of processes that  have the file open  next an entry is made in the per process open file table with a pointer  to the entry in the system wide open file table and some other fields these  other fields may include a pointer to the current location in the file for the next  read or write operation and the access mode in which the file is open  the open call returns a pointer to the appropriate entry in the per process   chapter  user space  user space kernel memory   a  kernel memory   b     t ilej d  do  secondary storage  secondary storage  figure in memory file system structures a file open b file read  file system table all file operations are then performed via this pointer the  file name may not be part of the open file table as the system has no use for  it once the appropriate fcb is located on disk it could be cached though to  save time on subsequent opens of the same file the name given to the entry  varies unix systems refer to it as a windows refers to it as a  when a process closes the file the per process table entry is removed and  the system wide entry s open count is decremented when all users that have  opened the file close it any updated metadata is copied back to the disk based  directory structure and the system wide open file table entry is removed  some systems complicate this scheme further by using the file system as an  interface to other system aspects such as networking for example in ufs the  system wide open file table holds the inodes and other information for files  and directories it also holds similar information for network connections and  devices in this way one mechanism can be used for multiple purposes  the caching aspects of file system structures should not be overlooked  most systems keep all information about an open file except for its actual data  blocks in memory the bsd unix system is typical in its use of caches wherever  disk i can be saved its average cache hit rate of percent shows that these  techniques are well worth implementing the bsd unix system is described  fully in appendix a  the operating structures of a file system implementation are summarized  in figure     partitions and mounting  the layout of a disk can have many variations depending on the operating  system a disk can be sliced into multiple partitions or a volume can span  multiple partitions on multiple disks the former layout is discussed here  while the latter which is more appropriately considered a form of raid is  covered in section  each partition can be either raw containing no file system or cooked  containing a file system is used where no file system is appropriate  unix swap space can use a raw partition for example as it uses its own format  on disk and does not use a file system likewise some databases use raw disk  and format the data to suit their needs raw disk can also hold information  needed by disk raid systems such as bit maps indicating which blocks are  mirrored and which have changed and need to be mirrored similarly raw disk  can contain a miniature database holding raid configuration information such  as which disks are members of each raid set raw disk use is further discussed  in section   boot information can be stored in a separate partition again it has its  own format because at boot time the system does not have the file system  code loaded and therefore cannot interpret the file system format rather boot  information is usually a sequential series of blocks loaded as an image into  memory execution of the image starts at a predefined location such as the first  byte this in turn knows enough about the file system structure to  be able to find and load the kernel and start it executing it can contain more  than the instructions for how to boot a specific operating system for instance  pcs and other systems can be multiple operating systems can be  installed on such a system how does the system know which one to boot  a boot loader that understands multiple file systems and multiple operating  systems can occupy the boot space once loaded it can boot one of the operating  systems available on the disk the disk can have multiple partitions each  containing a different type of file system and a different operating system  the which contains the operating system kernel and some  times other system files is mounted at boot time other volumes can be  automatically mounted at boot or manually mounted later depending on  the operating system as part of a successful mount operation the operating  system verifies that the device contains a valid file system it does so by asking  the device driver to read the device directory and verifying that the directory  has the expected format if the format is invalid the partition must have  its consistency checked and possibly corrected either with or without user  intervention finally the operating system notes in its in memory mount table  that a file system is mounted along with the type of the file system the details  of this function depend on the operating system microsoft windows based  systems mount each volume in a separate name space denoted by a letter  and a colon to record that a file system is mounted at f for example the  operating system places a pointer to the file system in a field of the device  structure corresponding to f when a process specifies the driver letter  the operating system finds the appropriate file system pointer and traverses  the directory structures on that device to find the specified file or directory  later versions of windows can mount a file system at any point within the  existing directory structure   chapter  on unix file systems can be mounted at any directory mounting is  implemented by setting a flag in the in memory copy of the inode for that  directory the flag indicates that the directory is a mount point a field then  points to an entry in the mount table indicating which device is mounted there  the mount table entry contains a pointer to the superblock of the file system on  that device this scheme enables the operating system to traverse its directory  structure switching seamlessly among file systems of varying types   virtual file systems  the previous section m akes it clear that modern operating systems must  concurrently support multiple types of file systems but how does an operating  system allow multiple types of file systems to be integrated into a directory  structure and how can users seamlessly move between file system types  as they navigate the file system space we now discuss some of these  implementation details  an obvious but suboptimal method of implementing multiple types of file  systems is to write directory and file routines for each type instead however  most operating systems including unix use object oriented techniques to  simplify organize and modularize the implementation the use of these  methods allows very dissimilar file system types to be implemented within  the same structure including network file systems such as nfs users can  access files that are contained within multiple file systems on the local disk or  even on file systems available across the network  data structures and procedures are used to isolate the basic system\\xad call functionality from the implementation details thus the file system  implementation consists of three major layers as depicted schematically in  figure the first layer is the file system interface based on the open  read write and close calls and on file descriptors  the second layer is called the layer the vfs layer  serves two important functions  it separates file system generic operations from their implementation  by defining a clean vfs interface several implementations for the vfs  interface may coexist on the same machine allowing transparent access  to different types of file systems mounted locally  it provides a mechanism for uniquely representing a file throughout a  network the vfs is based on a file representation structure called a  that contains a numerical designator for a network wide unique  file unix inodes are unique within only a single file system this  network wide uniqueness is required for support of network file systems  the kernel maintains one vnode structure for each active node file or  directory  thus the vfs distinguishes local files from remote ones and local files are  further distinguished according to their file system types  the vfs activates file system specific operations to handle local requests  according to their file system types and calls the nfs protocol procedures for  remote requests file handles are constructed from the relevant vnodes and  are passed as arguments to these procedures the layer implementing the    network  figure schematic view of a virtual file system  file system type or the remote file system protocol is the third layer of the  architecture  let s briefly examine the vfs architecture in linux the four main object  types defined by the linux vfs are  the inode object which represents an individual file  the file object which represents an open file  the superblock object which represents an entire file system  the dentry object which represents an individual directory entry  for each of these four object types the vfs defines a set of operations that  must be implemented every object of one of these types contains a pointer to  a f mction table the function table lists the addresses of the actual functions  that implement the defined operations for that particular object for example  an abbreviated api for some of the operations for the file object include  int open   open a file  ssize t read   read from a file  ssize t write   write to a file  int mmap   memory map a file  an implementation of the file object for a specific file type is required to imple\\xad ment each function specified in the definition of the file object the complete  definition ofthe file object is specified in the struct f ile operat ions which  is located in the file usr include linux fs h   chapter   thus the vfs software layer can perform an operation on one of these  objects by calling the appropriate function from the object s function table  without having to know in advance exactly what kind of object it is dealing  with the vfs does not know or care whether an inode represents a disk file  a directory file or a remote file the appropriate function for that file s read  operation will always be at the same place in its function table and the vfs  software layer will call that function without caring how the data are actually  read  the selection of directory allocation and directory management algorithms  significantly affects the efficiency performance and reliability of the file  system in this section we discuss the trade offs involved in choosing one  of these algorithms   linear list  the simplest method of implementing a directory is to use a linear list of file  names with pointers to the data blocks this method is simple to program  but time consuming to execute to create a new file we must first search the  directory to be sure that no existing file has the same name then we add a  new entry at the end of the directory to delete a file we search the directory for  the named file and then release the space allocated to it to reuse the directory  entry we can do one of several things we can mark the entry as unused by  assigning it a special name such as an all blank name or with a used unused  bit in each entry or we can attach it to a list of free directory entries a third  alternative is to copy the last entry in the directory into the freed location and  to decrease the length of the directory a linked list can also be used to decrease  the time required to delete a file  the real disadvantage of a linear list of directory entries is that finding a  file requires a linear search directory information is used frequently and users  will notice if access to it is slow in fact many operating systems implement a  software cache to store the most recently used directory information a cache  hit avoids the need to constantly reread the information from disk a sorted  list allows a binary search and decreases the average search time however the  requirement that the list be kept sorted may complicate creating and deleting  files since we may have to move substantial amounts of directory information  to maintain a sorted directory a more sophisticated tree data structure such  as a b h·ee might help here an advantage of the sorted list is that a sorted  directory listing can be produced without a separate sort step   hash table  another data structure used for a file directory is a with this  method a linear list stores the directory entries but a hash data structure is  also used the hash table takes a value computed from the file name and returns  a pointer to the file name in the linear list therefore it can greatly decrease the  directory search time insertion and deletion are also fairly straightforward  although some provision must be made for collisions situations in which  two file names hash to the same location     the major difficulties with a hash table are its generally fixed size and the  dependence of the hash function on that size for example assume that we  make a linear probing hash table that holds entries the hash function  converts file names into integers from to for instance by using the  remainder of a division by if we later try to create a th file we must  enlarge the directory hash table say to entries as a result we need  a new hash function that must map file narnes to the range to and we  must reorganize the existing directory entries to reflect their new hash function  values  alternatively a chained overflow hash table can be used each hash entry  can be a linked list instead of an individual value and we can resolve collisions  by adding the new entry to the linked list lookups may be somewhat slowed  because searching for a name might require stepping through a linked list of  colliding table entries still this method is likely to be much faster than a linear  search through the entire directory  the direct access nature of disks allows us flexibility in the implementation of  files in almost every case many files are stored on the same disk the main  problem is how to allocate space to these files so that disk space is utilized  effectively and files can be accessed quickly three major methods of allocating  disk space are in wide use contiguous linked and indexed each method has  advantages and disadvantages some systems such as data general s rdos  for its nova line of computers support all three more commonly a system  uses one method for all files within a file system type   contiguous allocation  requires that each file occupy a set of contiguous blocks  on disk disk addresses define a linear ordering on the disk with this  ordering assuming that only one job is accessil g the disk accessing block b   after block b normally requires no head movement when head movement  is needed from the last sector of one cylil der to the first sector of the next  cylinder the head need only move from one track to the next thus the number  of disk seeks required for accessing contiguously allocated files is minimal as  is seek time when a seek is finally needed the ibm vm cms operatil g system  uses contiguous allocation because it provides such good performance  contiguous allocation of a file is defined by the disk address and length in  block units of the first block if the file is n blocks long and starts at location  b then it occupies blocks b b  b   b n the directory entry for  each file indicates the address of the starting block and the length of the area  allocated for this file figure   accessing a file that has been allocated contiguously is easy for sequential  access the file system remembers the disk address of the last block referenced  and when necessary reads the next block for direct access to block i of a  file that starts at block b we can immediately access block b i thus both  sequential and direct access can be supported by contiguous allocation   chapter  directory  file start length  count  tr  mail  list  f  figure i contiguous allocation of disk space  contiguous allocation has some problems however one difficulty is  finding space for a new file the system chosen to manage free space determines  how this task is accomplished these management systems are discussed in  section any management system can be used but some are slower than  others  the contiguous allocation problem can be seen as a particular application  of the general problem discussed in section  which involves to satisfy a request of size n from a list of free holes first  fit and best fit are the most common strategies used to select a free hole from  the set of available holes simulations have shown that both first fit and best fit  are more efficient than worst fit in terms of both time and storage utilization  neither first fit nor best fit is clearly best in terms of storage utilization but  first fit is generally faster  all these algorithms suffer from the problem of  as files are allocated and deleted the free disk space is broken into pieces  external fragmentation exists whenever free space is broken into chunks it  becomes a problem when the largest contiguous chunk is insufficient for a  request storage is fragncented into a number of holes none of which is large  enough to store the data depending on the total amount of disk storage and the  average file size external fragmentation may be a minor or a major problem  one strategy for preventing loss of significant amounts of disk space to  external fragmentation is to copy an entire file system onto another disk or  tape the original disk is then freed completely creating one large contiguous  free space we then copy the files back onto the original disk by allocating  contiguous space from this one large hole this scheme effectively  all free space into one contiguous space solving the fragmentation  however the cost of this compaction is time and it can be particularly severe for  large hard disks that use contiguous allocation where compacting all the space    may take hours and may be necessary on a weekly basis some systems require  that this function be done with the file system unmounted during  this normal system operation generally cannot be permitted so  such compaction is avoided at all costs on production machines most modern  systems that need defragmentation can perform it during normal  system operations but the performance penalty can be substantial  another problem with contiguous allocation is determining how much  space is needed for a file when the file is created the total amount of space  it will need must be found and allocated how does the creator program or  person know the size of the file to be created in some cases this detennination  may be fairly simple copying an existing file for example in general however  the size of an output file may be difficult to estimate  if we allocate too little space to a file we may find that the file cannot  be extended especially with a best fit allocation strategy the space on both  sides of the file may be in use hence we cannot make the file larger in place  two possibilities then exist first the user program can be terminated with  an appropriate error message the user must then allocate more space and  run the program again these repeated runs may be costly to prevent them  the user will normally overestimate the amount of space needed resulting in  considerable wasted space the other possibility is to find a larger hole copy  the contents of the file to the new space and release the previous space this  series of actions can be repeated as long as space exists although it can be time  consuming however the user need never be informed explicitly about what  is happening the system continues despite the problem although more and  more slowly  even if the total amount of space needed for a file is known in advance  preallocation may be inefficient a file that will grow slowly over a long period   months or years must be allocated enough space for its final size even though  much of that space will be unused for a long time the file therefore has a large  amount of internal fragmentation  to minimize these drawbacks some operating systems use a modified  contiguous allocation scheme here a contiguous chunk of space is allocated  initially then if that amount proves not to be large enough another chunk of  contiguous space known as an is added the location of a file s blocks  is then recorded as a location and a block count plus a link to the first block  of the next extent on some systems the owner of the file can set the extent  size but this setting results in inefficiencies if the owner is incorrect internal  fragm entation can still be a problem if the extents are too large and external  fragmentation can become a problem as extents of varying sizes are allocated  and deallocated the commercial veritas file system uses extents to optimize  performance it is a high performance replacement for the standard unix ufs   linked allocation  solves all problems of contiguous allocation with linked  allocation each file is a linked list of disk blocks the disk blocks may be  scattered anywhere on the disk the directory contains a pointer to the first  and last blocks of the file for example a file of five blocks might start at block   and continue at block then block then block and finally block   figure  each block contains a pointer to the next block these pointers   chapter  directory      r      sc    figure i linked allocation of disk space  are not made available to the user thus if each block is bytes in size and  a disk address the poileter requires bytes then the user sees blocks of  bytes  to create a new file we simply create a new entry ile the directory with  linked allocation each directory entry has a pointer to the first disk block of the  file this pointer is initialized to nil the end of list pointer value to signify an  empty file the size field is also set to a write to the file causes the free space  management system to filed a free block and this new block is written to  and is linked to the end of the file to read a file we simply read blocks by  following the pointers from block to block there is no external fragmentation  with linked allocation and any free block on the free space list can be used to  satisfy a request the size of a file need not be declared when that file is created  a file can continue to grow as long as free blocks are available consequently  it is never necessary to compact disk space  linked allocation does have disadvantages however the major problem  is that it can be used effectively only for sequential access files to filed the  ith block of a file we must start at the begirueing of that file and follow the  pointers rnetil we get to the ith block each access to a pointer requires a disk  read and some require a disk seek consequently it is inefficient to support a  direct access capability for linked allocation files  another disadvantage is the space required for the pointers if a pointer  requires bytes out of a byte block then percent of the disk is being  used for pointers rather than for information each file requires slightly more  space than it would otherwise  the usual solution to this problem is to collect blocks into multiples called  and to allocate clusters rather than blocks for instance the file system  may define a cluster as four blocks and operate on the disk only in cluster  units pointers then use a much smaller percentage of the file s disk space  this method allows the logical to physical block mapping to remain simple    but improves disk throughput because fewer disk head seeks are required  and decreases the space needed for block allocation and free list management  the cost of this approach is an increase in internal fragmentation because  more space is wasted when a cluster is partially full than when a block is  partially full clusters can be used to improve the disk access time for many  other algorithms as welt so they are used in most file systems  yet another problem of linked allocation is reliability recall that the files  are linked together by pointers scattered all over the disk and consider what  would happen if a pointer were lost or damaged a bug in the operating system  software or a disk hardware failure might result in picking up the wrong  pointer this error could in turn result in linking into the free space list or into  another file one partial solution is to use doubly linked lists and another is  to store the file name and relative block number in each block however these  schemes require even more overhead for each file  an important variation on linked allocation is the use of a   fat this simple but efficient method of disk space allocation is used  by the ms dos and os operating systems a section of disk at the beginning  of each volume is set aside to contain the table the table has one entry for  each disk block and is indexed by block number the fat is used in much the  same way as a linked list the directory entry contains the block number of the  first block of the file the table entry indexed by that block number contains  the block number of the next block in the file this chain continues until it  reaches the last block which has a special end of file value as the table entry  an unused block is indicated by a table value of allocating a new block to  a file is a simple matter of finding the first valued table entry and replacing  the previous end of file value with the address of the new block the is then  replaced with the end of file value an illustrative example is the fat structure  shown in figure for a file consisting of disk blocks  and  directory entry  name start block          number of disk blocks  fat  figure file allocation table   chapter  the fat allocation scheme can result in a significant number of disk head  seeks unless the fat is cached the disk head must move to the start of the  volume to read the fat and find the location of the block in question then  move to the location of the block itself in the worst case both moves occur for  each of the blocks a benefit is that random access time is improved because  the disk head can find the location of any block by reading the information in  the fat   indexed allocation  linked allocation solves the external fragmentation and size declaration prob\\xad lems of contiguous allocation however in the absence of a fat linked  allocation cannot support efficient direct access since the pointers to the blocks  are scattered with the blocks themselves all over the disk and must be retrieved  in order solves this problem by bringil g all the pointers  together into one location the blo ct  each file has its own index block which is an array of disk block addresses  the i th entry in the index block points to the i block of the file the directory  contains the address of the index block figure  to find and read the ijz  block we use the pointer in the ilz index block entry this scheme is similar to  the paging scheme described il section  when the file is created all pointers in the index block are set to nil when  the ith block is first written a block is obtained from the free space manager  and its address is put in the ith index block entry  indexed allocation supports direct access without suffering from external  fragmentation because any free block on the disk can satisfy a request for more  space indexed allocation does suffer from wasted space however the pointer  overhead of the index block is generally greater than the pointer overhead of  linked allocation consider a common case in which we have a file of only one  or two blocks with linked allocation we lose the space of only one pointer per  directory  file  jeep    figure indexed allocation of disk space   allocation methods  block with indexed allocation an entire index block must be allocated even  if only one or two pointers will be non nil  this point raises the question of how large the index block should be every  file must have an index block so we want the index block to be as small as  possible if the index block is too small however it will not be able to hold  enough pointers for a large file and a mechanism will have to be available to  deal with this issue mechanisms for this purpose include the following  c linked scheme an index block is normally one disk block thus it can  be read and written directly by itself to allow for large files we can link  together several index blocks for example an index block might contain a  small header giving the name of the file and a set of the first disk block  addresses the next address the last word in the index block is nil for a  small file or is a pointer to another index block for a large file  • multilevel index a variant of linked representation uses a first level index  block to point to a set of second level index blocks which in tum point to  the file blocks to access a block the operating system uses the first level  index to find a second level index block and then uses that block to find the  desired data block this approach could be continued to a third or fourth  level depending on the desired maximum file size with byte blocks  we could store four byte pointers in an index block two levels of  indexes allow data blocks and a file size of up to gb  • combined scheme another alternative used in the ufs is to keep the  first say pointers of the index block in the file s inode the first  of these pointers point to direct blocks that is they contain addresses of  blocks that contain data of the file thus the data for small files of no more  than blocks do not need a separate index block if the block size is kb  then up to kb of data can be accessed directly the next three pointers  point to indirect blocks the first points to a single indirect block which  is an index block containing not data but the addresses of blocks that do  contain data the second points to a double indirect block which contains  the address of a block that contains the addresses of blocks that contain  pointers to the actual data blocks the last pointer contains the address of a  triple indirect block under this method the number of blocks that can be  allocated to a file exceeds the amount of space addressable by the four byte  file pointers used by many operating systems a bit file pointer reaches  only bytes or gb many unix implementations including solaris and  ibm s aix now support up to bit file pointers pointers of this size allow  files and file systems to be terabytes in size a unix inode is shown in  figure  indexed allocation schemes suffer from some of the same performance  problems as does linked allocation specifically the index blocks can be cached  in memory but the data blocks may be spread all over a volume   performance  the allocation methods that we have discussed vary in their storage efficiency  and data block access times both are important criteria in selecting the proper  method or methods for an operating system to implement   chapter implementing file systems  figure the unix inode  before selecting an allocation method we need to determine how the  systems will be used a system with mostly sequential access should not use  the same method as a system with mostly random access  for any type of access contiguous allocation requires only one access to get  a disk block since we can easily keep the initial address of the file in memory  we can calculate immediately the disk address of the ith block or the next  block and read it directly  for linked allocation we can also keep the address of the next block in  memory and read it directly this method is fine for sequential access for  direct access however an access to the ith block might require i disk reads this  problem indicates why linked allocation should not be used for an application  requiring direct access  as a result some systems support direct access files by using contiguous  allocation and sequential access files by using linked allocation for these  systems the type of access to be made must be declared when the file is  created a file created for sequential access will be linked and cannot be used  for direct access a file created for direct access will be contiguous and can  support both direct access and sequential access but its maximum length must  be declared when it is created in this case the operating system must have  appropriate data structures and algorithms to support both allocation methods  files can be converted from one type to another by the creation of a new file of  the desired type into which the contents of the old file are copied the old file  may then be deleted and the new file renamed  indexed allocation is more complex if the index block is already in memory  then the access can be made directly however keeping the index block in  memory requires considerable space if this memory space is not available  then we may have to read first the index block and then the desired data  block for a two level index two index block reads might be necessary for an     extremely large file accessing a block near the end of the file would require  reading in all the index blocks before the needed data block finally could  be read thus the performance of indexed allocation depends on the index  structure on the size of the file and on the position of the block desired  some systems combine contiguous allocation with indexed allocation by  using contiguous allocation for small files up to three or four blocks and  automatically switching to an indexed allocation if the file grows large since  most files are small and contiguous allocation is efficient for small files average  performance can be quite good  for instance the version of the unix operating system from sun microsys\\xad tems was changed in to improve performance in the file system allocation  algorithm the performance measurements indicated that the maximum disk  throughput on a typical workstation a mips sparcstation took percent  of the cpu and produced a disk bandwidth of only me per second to  improve performance sun made changes to allocate space in clusters of kb  whenever possible kb was the maximum size of a dma transfer on sun  systems at that time this allocation reduced external fragmentation and thus  seek and latency times in addition the disk reading routines were optimized  to read in these large clusters the inode structure was left unchanged as a  result of these changes plus the use of read ahead and free behind discussed  in section  percent less cpu was used and throughput substantially  improved  many other optimizations are in use given the disparity between cpu  speed and disk speed it is not unreasonable to add thousands of extra  instructions to the operating system to save just a few disk head movements  furthermore this disparity is increasing over time to the point where hundreds  of thousands of instructions reasonably could be used to optimize head  movements  since disk space is limited we need to reuse the space from deleted files for new  files if possible write once optical disks only allow one write to any given  sector and thus such reuse is not physically possible to keep track of free disk  space the system maintains a the free space list records all free  disk blocks those not allocated to some file or directory to create a file we  search the free space list for the required amount of space and allocate that  space to the new file this space is then removed from the free space list when  a file is deleted its disk space is added to the free space list the free space list  despite its name might not be implemented as a list as we discuss next   bit vector  frequently the free space list is implemented as a or each  block is represented by bit if the block is free the bit is if the block is  allocated the bit is  for example consider a disk where blocks         and are free and the rest of the blocks are allocated the free space  bit map would be   chapter     the main advantage of this approach is its relative simplicity and its  efficiency in finding the first free block or n consecutive free blocks on the  disk indeed many computers supply bit manipulation instructions that can  be used effectively for that purpose for example the intel family starting with  the and the motorola family starting with the have instructions  that return the offset in a word of the first bit with the value these processors  have powered pcs and macintosh systems respectively one technique for  finding the first free block on a system that uses a bit vector to allocate disk  space is to sequentially check each word in the bit map to see whether that  value is not since a valued word contains only bits and represents a set  of allocated blocks the first non word is scanned for the first bit which is  the location of the first free block the calculation of the block number is   number of bits per word x number of value words offset of first bit  again we see hardware features driving software functionality unfor\\xad tunately bit vectors are inefficient unless the entire vector is kept in main  memory and is written to disk occasionally for recovery needs keeping it in  main memory is possible for smaller disks but not necessarily for larger ones  a gb disk with byte blocks would need a bit map of over kb to  track its free blocks although clustering the blocks in groups of four reduces  this number to around kb per disk a tb disk with kb blocks requires  mb to store its bit map given that disk size constantly increases the problem  with bit vectors will continue to escalate a pb file system would take a gb  bitmap just to manage its free space   linked list  another approach to free space management is to link together all the free  disk blocks keeping a pointer to the first free block in a special location on the  disk and caching it in memory this first block contains a pointer to the next  free disk block and so on recall our earlier example section  in which  blocks        and were free and the  rest of the blocks were allocated in this situation we would keep a pointer to  block as the first free block block would contain a pointer to block which  would point to block which would point to block which would point to  block and so on figure  this scheme is not efficient to traverse the  list we must read each block which requires substantial i time fortunately  however traversing the free list is not a frequent action usually the operating  system simply needs a free block so that it can allocate that block to a file so  the first block in the free list is used the fat method incorporates free block  accounting into the allocation data structure no separate method is needed   grouping  a modification of the free list approach stores the addresses of n free blocks  in the first free block the first n of these blocks are actually free the last  block contains the addresses of another n free blocks and so on the addresses    figure linked free space list on disk  of a large number of free blocks can now be found quickly unlike the situation  when the standard linked list approach is used   counting  another approach takes advantage of the fact that generally several contigu\\xad ous blocks may be allocated or freed simultaneously particularly when space is  allocated with the contiguous allocation algorithm or through clustering thus  rather than keeping a list of n free disk addresses we can keep the address of  the first free block and the number n of free contiguous blocks that follow the  first block each entry in the free space list then consists of a disk address and  a count although each entry requires more space than would a simple disk  address the overall list is shorter as long as the count is generally greater than   note that this method of tracking free space is similar to the extent method  of allocating blocks these entries can be stored in a b tree rather than a linked  list for efficient lookup insertion and deletion   space maps  sun s zfs file system was designed to encompass huge numbers of files  directories and even file systems in zfs we can create file system hierarchies  the resulting data structures could have been large and inefficient if they had  not been designed and implemented properly on these scales metadata i  can have a large performance impact consider for example that if the free\\xad space list is implemented as a bit map bit maps must be modified both when  blocks are allocated and when they are freed freeing gb of data on a tb  disk could cause thousands of blocks of bit maps to be updated because those  data blocks could be scattered over the entire disk   chapter   zfs uses a combination of techniques in its free space managem ent  algorithm to control the size of data structures and minimize the i needed  to manage those structures first zfs creates to divide the space  on the device into chucks of manageable size a given volume may contain  hundreds of metaslabs each metaslab has an associated space map zfs uses  the counting algorithm to store information about free blocks rather than  write count structures to disk it uses log structured file system techniques  to record them the space map is a log of all block activity allocatil g and  freemg in time order in countil g format when zfs decides to allocate or  free space from a metaslab it loads the associated space map into memory  in a balanced tree structure for very efficient operation indexed by offset  and replays the log into that structure the in memory space map is then an  accurate representation of the allocated and free space in the metaslab zfs also  condenses the map as much as possible by combining contiguous free blocks  into a sil gle entry finally the free space list is updated on disk as part of  the transaction oriented operations of zfs during the collection and sortmg  phase block requests can still occur and zfs satisfies these requests from the  log in essence the log plus the balanced tree is the free list  now that we have discussed various block allocation and directory\\xad management options we can further consider their effect on performance  and efficient disk use disks tend to represent a major bottleneck in system  performance since they are the slowest main computer component in this  section we discuss a variety of techniques used to improve the efficiency and  performance of secondary storage   efficiency  the efficient use of disk space depends heavily on the disk allocation and  directory algorithms in use for instance unix inodes are preallocated on a  volume even an empty disk has a percentage of its space lost to inodes  however by preallocating the inodes and spreading them across the volume  we improve the file system s performance this improved performance results  from the unix allocation and free space algorithms which try to keep a file s  data blocks near that file s inode block to reduce seek time  as another example let s reconsider the clustermg scheme discussed in  section which aids in file seek and file transfer performance at the cost  of internal fragmentation to reduce this fragmentation bsd unix varies the  cluster size as a file grows large clusters are used where they can be filled and  small clusters are used for small files and the last cluster of a file this system  is described in appendix a  the types of data normally kept in a file s directory or inode entry also  require consideration commonly a last write date is recorded to supply  information to the user and to determine whether the file needs to be backed  up some systems also keep a last access date so that a user can determine  when the file was last read the result of keeping this information is that  whenever the file is read a field in the directory structure must be written    to that means the block must be read into memory a section changed and  the block written back out to disk because operations on disks occur only in  block or cluster chunks so any time a file is opened for reading its directory  entry must be read and written as well this requirement can be inefficient for  frequently accessed files so we must weigh its benefit against its performance  cost when designing a file system generally every data item associated with a  file needs to be considered for its effect on efficiency and performance  as an example consider how efficiency is affected by the size of the pointers  used to access data most systems use either or bit pointers throughout  the operating system these pointer sizes limit the length of a file to either   kb or bytes gb some systems implement bit pointers to  increase this limit to bytes which is a very large number indeed however   bit pointers take more space to store and in turn make the allocation and  free space management methods linked lists indexes and so on use more  disk space  one of the difficulties in choosing a pointer size or indeed any fixed  allocation size within an operating system is planning for the effects of  changing technology consider that the ibm pc xt had a mb hard drive  and an ms dos file system that could support only mb each fat entry  was bits pointing to an kb cluster as disk capacities increased larger  disks had to be split into mb partitions because the file system could not  track blocks beyond mb as hard disks with capacities of over mb became  common the disk data structures and algorithms in ms dos had to be modified  to allow larger file systems each fat entry was expanded to bits and later  to bits the initial file system decisions were made for efficiency reasons  however with the advent of ms dos version millions of computer users were  inconvenienced when they had to switch to the new larger file system sun s  zfs file system uses bit pointers which theoretically should never need  to be extended the minimum mass of a device capable of storing bytes  using atomic level storage would be about trillion kilograms  as another example consider the evolution of sun s solaris operating  system originally many data structures were of fixed length allocated at  system startup these structures included the process table and the open file  table when the process table became full no more processes could be created  when the file table became full no more files could be opened the system  would fail to provide services to users table sizes could be increased only by  recompiling the kernel and rebooting the system since the release of solaris   almost all kernel structures have been allocated dynamically eliminating  these artificial limits on system performance of course the algorithms that  manipulate these tables are more complicated and the operating system is a  little slower because it must dynamically allocate and deallocate table entries  but that price is the usual one for more general functionality   performance  even after the basic file system algorithms have been selected we can still  improve performance in several ways as will be discussed in chapter  most disk controllers include local memory to form an on board cache that is  large enough to store entire tracks at a time once a seek is performed the  track is read into the disk cache starting at the sector under the disk head   chapter   using  read and write  tile system  figure  without a unified buffer cache   reducing latency time the disk controller then transfers any sector requests  to the operating system once blocks make it from the disk controller into main  memory the operating system may cache the blocks there  some systems maintain a separate section of main memory for a  where blocks are kept under the assumption that will be used  again shortly other systems cache file data using a the page  cache uses virtual memory techniques to cache file data as pages rather than  as file system oriented blocks cachii lg file data using virtual addresses is far  more efficient than caching through physical disk blocks as accesses interface  with virtual memory rather than the file system several systems including  solaris linux and windows nt and xp use caching to cache  both process pages and file data this is known as  some versions of unix and linux provide a to  illustrate the benefits of the unified buffer cache consider the two alternatives  for opening and accessing a file one approach is to use memory mapping   section  the second is to use the standard system calls read and  write without a unified buffer cache we have a situation similar to figure   here the read and write system calls go through the buffer cache  the memory mapping call however requires using two caches the page  cache and the buffer cache a memory mapping proceeds by reading in disk  blocks from the file system and storing them in the buffer cache because the  virtual memory system does not interface with the buffer cache the contents  of the file in the buffer cache must be copied into the page cache this situation  is known as and requires caching file system data twice not  only does it waste memory but it also wastes significant cpu and i o cycles due  to the extra data movement within system memory in addition inconsistencies  between the two caches can result in corrupt files in contrast when a unified  buffer cache is provided both memory mapping and the read and write  system calls use the same page cache this has the benefit of a voiding double    memory mapped  buffer cache  file system  figure  using a unified buffer cache  caching and it allows the virtual memory system to manage file system data  the unified buffer cache is shown in figure  regardless of whether we are caching disk blocks or pages or both lru   section  seems a reasonable general purpose algorithm for block or page  replacement however the evolution of the solaris page caching algorithms  reveals the difficulty in choosil g an algorithm solaris allows processes and the  page cache to share unused memory versions earlier than solaris made  no distmction between allocatmg pages to a process and allocating them to  the page cache as a result a system performing many i operations used  most of the available memory for caching pages because of the high rates  of i the page scanner section  reclaimed pages from processes\\xad rather than from the page cache when free memory ran low solaris and  solaris optionally implemented priority paging in which the page scanner  gives priority to process pages over the page cache solaris applied a fixed  limit to process pages and the file system page cache preventing either from  forcing the other out of memory solaris and again changed the algorithms  to maximize memory use and mmimize thrashing  another issue that can affect the performance of i is whether writes to  the file system occur synchronously or asynchronously  occur in the order in which the disk subsystem receives and the writes  are not buffered thus the calling routine must wait for the data to reach the  disk drive before it can proceed in an the data are stored  in the cache and control returns to the caller asynchronous writes are done  the majority of the time however metadata writes among others can be  synchronous operating systems frequently include a flag in the open system  call to allow a process to request that writes be performed synchxonously for  example databases use this feature for atomic transactions to assure that data  reach stable storage in the required order  some systems optimize their page cache by using different replacement  algorithms depending on the access type of the file a file being read or  written sequentially should not have its pages replaced in lru order because  the most recently used page will be used last or perhaps never again instead  sequential access can be optimized by techniques known as free behind and  read ahead removes a page from the buffer as soon as the next   chapter   page is requested the previous are not likely to be used again and  waste buffer space with a requested page and several subsequent  pages are read and cached these pages are likely to be requested after the  current page is processed retrieving these data from the disk in one transfer  and caching them saves a considerable ancount of time one might think that  a track cache on the controller would elincinate the need for read ahead on a  multiprogrammed system however because of the high latency and overhead  involved in making many small transfers from the track cache to main memory  performing a read ahead remains beneficial  the page cache the file system and the disk drivers have some interesting  interactions when data are written to a disk file the pages are buffered in the  cache and the disk driver sorts its output queue according to disk address  these two actions allow the disk driver to minimize disk head seeks and to  write data at times optimized for disk rotation unless synchronous writes are  required a process writing to disk simply writes into the cache and the system  asynchronously writes the data to disk when convenient the user process sees  very fast writes when data are read from a disk file the block i system does  some read ahead however writes are much more nearly asynchronous than  are reads thus output to the disk through the file system is often faster than  is input for large transfers counter to intuition  files and directories are kept both in main memory and on disk and care must  be taken to ensure that a system failure does not result in loss of data or in data  inconsistency we deal with these issues in this section as well as how a system  can recover from such a failure  a system crash can cause inconsistencies among on disk file system data  structures such as directory structures free block pointers and free fcb  pointers many file systems apply changes to these structures in place a  typical operation such as creating a file can involve many structural changes  within the file system on the disk directory structures are modified fcbs are  allocated data blocks are allocated and the free counts for all of these blocks  are decreased these changes can be interrupted by a crash and inconsistencies  among the structures can result for example the free fcb count might indicate  that an fcb had been allocated but the directory structure might not point to  the fcb compounding this problem is the caching that operating systems do  to optimize i performance some changes may go directly to disk while  others may be cached if the cached changes do not reach disk before a crash  occurs more corruption is possible  in addition to crashes bugs in file system implementation disk controllers  and even user applications can corrupt a file system file systems have varying  methods to deal with corruption depending on the file system data structures  and algorithms we deal with these issues next   consistency checking  whatever the cause of corruption a file system must first detect the problems  and then correct them for detection a scan of all the metadata on each file    system can confirm or deny the consistency of the systenl unfortunately this  scan can take minutes or hours and should occur every time the system boots  alternatively a file system can record its state within the file system metadata  at the start of any metadata change a status bit is set to indicate that the  metadata is in flux if all updates to the metadata complete successfully the file  system can clear that bit it however the status bit remains set a consistency  checker is run  the systems program such as f s ck in unix or  chkdsk in windows compares the data in the directory structure with the  data blocks on disk and tries to fix any inconsistencies it finds the allocation  and free space management algorithms dictate what types of problems the  checker can find and how successful it will be in fixing them for instance if  linked allocation is used and there is a link from any block to its next block  then the entire file can be reconstructed from the data blocks and the directory  structure can be recreated in contrast the loss of a directory entry on an  indexed allocation system can be disastrous because the data blocks have no  knowledge of one another for this reason unix caches directory entries for  reads but any write that results in space allocation or other metadata changes  is done synchronously before the corresponding data blocks are written of  course problems can still occur if a synchronous write is interrupted by a crash   log structured file systems  computer scientists often fin d that algorithms and technologies origil ally used  in one area are equally useful in other areas such is the case with the database  log based recovery algorithms described in section  these logging algo  rithms have been applied successfully to the of consistency il c  ll  the resulting implementations are known as   or file systems  note that with the consistency checking approach discussed in the pre\\xad ceding section we essentially allow structures to break and repair them on  recovery however there are several problems with this approach one is that  the inconsistency may be irreparable the consistency check may not be able to  recover the structures resulting in loss of files and even entire directories  consistency checking can require human intervention to resolve conflicts  and that is inconvenient if no human is available the system can remain  unavailable until the human tells it how to proceed consistency checking also  takes system and clock time to check terabytes of data hours of clock time  may be required  the solution to this problem is to apply log based recovery techniques to  file system metadata updates both ntfs and the veritas file system use this  method and it is included in recent versions of ufs on solaris in fact it is  becoming common on many operating systems  fundamentally all metadata changes are written  each set of operations for performing a specific task is a  the changes are written to this log they are considered to be committed  and the system call can return to the user process allowing it to continue  execution meanwhile these log entries are replayed across the actual file\\xad system structures as the changes are made a pointer is updated to indicate   chapter  which actions have completed and which are still incomplete when an entire  committed transaction is completed it is removed from the log file which is  actually a circular buffer a cb ul n· writes to the end of its space and  then continues at the beginning overwriting older values as it goes we would  not want the buffer to write over data that had not yet been saved so that  scenario is avoided the log may be in a separate section of the file system or  even on a separate disk spindle it is more efficient but more complex to have  it under separate read and write heads thereby decreasing head contention  and seek times  if the system crashes the log file will contain zero or more transactions  any transactions it contains were not completed to the file system even though  they were committed by the operating system so they must now be completed  the transactions can be executed from the pointer until the work is complete  so that the file system structures remain consistent the only problem occurs  when a transaction was aborted that is was not committed before the system  crashed any changes from such a transaction that were applied to the file  system must be undone again preserving the consistency of the file system  this recovery is all that is needed after a crash elimil ating any problems with  consistency checking  a side benefit of using logging on disk metadata updates is that those  updates proceed much faster than when they are applied directly to the on disk  data structures the reason for this improvement is found in the performance  advantage of sequential i over random i the costly synchronous random  meta data writes are turned into much less costly synchronous sequential writes  to the log structured file system s loggil g area those changes in turn are  replayed asynchronously via random writes to the appropriate structures  the overall result is a significant gain in performance of metadata oriented  operations such as file creation and deletion   other solutions  another alternative to consistency checking is employed by network appli\\xad ance s wafl file system and sun s zfs file system these systems never  overwrite blocks with new data rather a transaction writes all data and meta\\xad data changes to new blocks when the transaction is complete the metadata  structures that pointed to the old versions of these blocks are updated to point  to the new blocks the file system can then remove the old pointers and the old  blocks and make them available for reuse if the old pointers and blocks are  kept a is created the snapshot is a view of the file system before the  last update took place this solution should require no consistency checking if  the pointer update is done atomically wafl does have a consistency checker  however so some failure scenarios can still cause metadata corruption see   for details of the wafl file system  sun s zfs takes an even more im ovative approach to disk consistency  it never overwrites blocks just as is the case with wafl however zfs goes  further and provides check summing of all metadata and data blocks this  solution when combined with raid assures that data are always correct zfs  therefore has no consistency checker more details on zfs are found in section        backup and restore  magnetic disks sometimes fail and care must be taken to ensure that the data  lost in such a failure are not lost forever to this end system programs can be  used to data from disk to another storage device such as a floppy  disk magnetic tape optical disk or other hard disk recovery from the loss of  an individual file or of an entire disk may then be a matter of the  data from backup  to minimize the copying needed we can use information from each file s  directory entry for instance if the backup program knows when the last  backup of a file was done and the file s last write date in the directory indicates  that the file has not changed since that date then the file does not need to be  copied again a typical backup schedule may then be as follows   copy to a backup medium all files from the disk this is called a  to another medium all files changed since day this is an  day copy to another medium all files changed since day  day n copy to another medium all files changed since day n then  go back to day  the new cycle can have its backup written over the previous set or onto  a new set of backup media in this manner we can restore an entire disk  by starting restores with the full backup and continuing through each of the  incremental backups of course the larger the value of n the greater the  number of media that must be read for a complete restore an added advantage  of this backup cycle is that we can restore any file accidentally deleted during  the cycle by retrieving the deleted file from the backup of the previous day the  length of the cycle is a compromise between the amount of backup medium  needed and the number of days back from which a restore can be done to  decrease the number of tapes that must be read to do a restore an option is to  perform a full backup and then each day back up all files that have changed  since the full backup in this way a restore can be done via the most recent  incremental backup and the full backup with no other incremental backups  needed the trade off is that more files will be modified each day so each  successive incremental backup involves more files and more backup media  a user ncay notice that a particular file is missing or corrupted long after  the damage was done for this reason we usually plan to take a full backup  from time to time that will be saved forever it is a good idea to store these  permanent backups far away from the regular backups to protect against  hazard such as a fire that destroys the computer and all the backups too  and if the backup cycle reuses media we must take care not to reuse the   chapter   media too many times if the media wear out it might not be possible to  restore any data from the backups  network file systems are commonplace they are typically integrated with  the overall directory structure and interface of the client system nfs is a  good example of a widely used well implemented client server network file  system here we use it as an example to explore the implementation details of  network file systems  nfs is both an implementation and a specification of a software system for  accessing remote files across lans or even wans nfs is part of onc which  most unix vendors and some pc operating systems support the implementa\\xad tion described here is part of the solaris operating system which is a modified  version of unix svr running on sun workstations and other hardware it uses  either the tcp or udp ip protocol depending on the interconnecting network  the specification and the implementation are intertwined in our description of  nfs whenever detail is needed we refer to the sun implementation whenever  the description is general it applies to the specification also  there are multiple versions of nfs with the latest being version here  we describe version as that is the one most commonly deployed   overview  nfs views a set of interconnected workstations as a set of independent machines  with independent file systems the goal is to allow some degree of sharing  among these file systems on explicit request in a transparent manner sharing  is based on a client server relationship a machine may be and often is both a  client and a server sharing is allowed between any pair of machines to ensure  machine independence sharing of a remote file system affects only the client  machine and no other machine  so that a remote directory will be accessible in a transparent manner  from a particular machine say from ml a client of that machine must  first carry out a mount operation the semantics of the operation involve  mounting a remote directory over a directory of a local file system once the  mount operation is completed the mounted directory looks like an integral  subtree of the local file system replacing the subtree descending from the  local directory the local directory becomes the name of the root of the newly  mounted directory specification of the remote directory as an argument for the  mount operation is not done transparently the location or host name of the  remote directory has to be provided however fron l then on users on machine  ml can access files in the remote directory in a totally transparent manner  to illustrate file mounting consider the file system depicted in figure  where the triangles represent subtrees of directories that are of interest the  figure shows three independent file systems of machines named u and   at this point on each machine only the local files can be accessed figure   a shows the effects of mounting usr shared over u usr local  this figure depicts the view users on u have of their file system notice that  after the mount is complete they can access any file within the dirl directory    u s s  usr usr usr  figure three independent file systems  using the prefix usr local dir the original directory usr local on that  machine is no longer visible  subject to access rights accreditation any file system or any directory  within a file system can be mounted remotely on top of any local directory  diskless workstations can even mount their own roots from servers cascading  mounts are also permitted in some nfs implementations that is a file system  can be mounted over another file system that is remotely mounted not local a  machine is affected by only those mounts that it has itself invoked mounting a  remote file system does not give the client access to other file systems that were  by chance mounted over the former file system thus the mount mechanism  does not exhibit a transitivity property  in figure b we illustrate cascading mounts the figure shows the  result of mounting s usr dir over u usr local dir which is already  remotely mounted from users can access files within dir on u using the  u u   a b  figure mounting in nfs a mounts b cascading mounts   chapter  prefix usr local dir if a shared file system is mounted over a user s home  directories on all machines in a network the user can log into any workstation  and get his honce environment this property permits  one of the design goals of nfs was to operate in a heterogeneous environ\\xad ment of different machines operating systems and network architectures  the nfs specification is independent of these media and thus encourages  other implementations this independence is achieved through the use of  rpc primitives built on top of an external data representation xdr proto\\xad col used between two implementation independent interfaces hence if the  system consists of heterogeneous machines and file systems that are properly  interfaced to nfs file systems of different types can be mounted both locally  and remotely  the nfs specification distinguishes between the services provided by a  mount mechanism and the actual remote file access services accordingly two  separate protocols are specified for these services a mount protocol and a  protocol for remote file accesses the the protocols are specified as  sets of rpcs these rpcs are the building blocks used to implement transparent  remote file access   the mount protocol  the establishes the initial logical connection between a server  and a client in sun s implementation each machine has a server process  outside the kernel performing the protocol functions  a mount operation includes the name of the remote directory to be  mounted and the name of the server machine storing it the mount request  is mapped to the corresponding rpc and is forwarded to the mount server  running on the specific server machine the server maintains an  that specifies local file systems that it exports for mounting along with names  of machines that are permitted to mount them in solaris this list is the  i etc dfs dfstab which can be edited only by a superuser the specification  can also include access rights such as read only to simplify the maintenance  of export lists and mount tables a distributed naming scheme can be used to  hold this information and make it available to appropriate clients  recall that any directory within an exported file system can be mounted  remotely by an accredited machine a component unit is such a directory when  the server receives a mount request that conforms to its export list it returns to  the client a file handle that serves as the key for further accesses to files within  the mounted file system the file handle contains all the information that the  server needs to distinguish an individual file it stores in unix terms the file  handle consists of a file system identifier and an inode number to identify the  exact mounted directory within the exported file system  the server also maintains a list of the client machines and the corresponding  currently mounted directories this list is used mainly for administrative  purposes for instance for notifying all clients that the server is going down  only through addition and deletion of entries in this list can the server state  be affected by the mount protocol  usually a system has a static mounting preconfiguration that is established  at boot time i etc vfstab in solaris however this layout can be modified in    addition to the actual mount procedure the mount protocol includes several  other procedures such as unmount and return export list   the nfs protocol  the nfs protocol provides a set of rpcs for remote file operations the  procedures support the following operations  searching for a file within a directory  reading a set of directory entries  manipulating links and directories  accessing file attributes  reading and writing files  these procedures can be invoked only after a file handle for the remotely  mounted directory has been established  the omission of open and close operations is intentional a promi\\xad nent feature of nfs servers is that they are stateless servers do not maintain  information about their clients from one access to another no parallels to  unix s open files table or file structures exist on the server side consequently  each request has to provide a full set of arguments including a unique file  identifier and an absolute offset inside the file for the appropriate operations  the resulting design is robust no special measures need be taken to recover  a server after a crash file operations must be idempotent for this purpose  every nfs request has a sequence number allowing the server to determine if  a request is duplicated or if any are missing  maintaining the list of clients that we mentioned seems to violate the  statelessness of the server however this list is not essential for the correct  operation of the client or the server and hence it does not need to be restored  after a server crash consequently it might include inconsistent data and is  treated as only a hint  a further implication of the stateless server philosophy and a result of the  synchrony of an rpc is that modified data including indirection and status  blocks must be committed to the server s disk before results are returned to  the client that is a client can cache write blocks but when it flushes them  to the server it assumes that they have reached the server s disks the server  must write all nfs data synchronously thus a server crash and recovery  will be invisible to a client all blocks that the server is managing for the  client will be intact the consequent performance penalty can be large because  the advantages of caching are lost performance can be increased using  storage with its own nonvolatile cache usually battery backed up memory  the disk controller ackiwwledges the disk write when the write is stored in  the nonvolatile cache in essence the host sees a very fast synchronous write  these blocks remain intact even after system crash and are written from this  stable storage to disk periodically  a single nfs write procedure call is guaranteed to be atomic and is not  intermixed with other write calls to the same file the nfs protocol however  does not provide concurrency control mechanisms a write system call may   chapter  client server  figure schematic view of the nfs architecture  be broken down into several rpc writes because each nfs write or read call  can contain up to kb of data and udp packets are limited to bytes as a  result two users writing to the same remote file may get their data intermixed  the claim is that because lock management is inherently stateful a service  outside the nfs should provide locking and solaris does users are advised  to coordinate access to shared files using mechanisms outside the scope of nfs  nfs is integrated into the operating system via a vfs as an illustration  of the architecture let s trace how an operation on an already open remote  file is handled follow the example in figure  the client initiates the  operation with a regular system call the operating system layer maps this  call to a vfs operation on the appropriate vnode the vfs layer identifies the  file as a remote one and invokes the appropriate nfs procedure an rpc call  is made to the nfs service layer at the remote server this call is reinjected to  the vfs layer on the remote system which finds that it is local and invokes  the appropriate file system operation this path is retraced to return the result  an advantage of this architecture is that the client and the server are identical  thus a machine may be a client or a server or both the actual service on each  server is performed by kernel threads   path name translation  in nfs involves the parsing of a path name such as   usr local dir file txt into separate directory entries or components   usr  local and dir path name translation is done by breaking the  path into component names and perform ing a separate nfs lookup call for  every pair of component name and directory vnode once a nunt point is  crossed every component lookup causes a separate rpc to the server this    expensive path name traversal scheme is needed since the layout of each  client s logical name space is unique dictated by the mounts the client has  performed it would be itluch more efficient to hand a server a path name  and receive a target vnode once a mount point is encountered at any point  however there might be another mount point for the particular client of whicb  the stateless server is unaware  so that lookup is fast a directory name lookup cache on the client side  holds the vnodes for remote directory names this cache speeds up references  to files with the same initial path name the directory cache is discarded when  attributes returned from the server do not match the attributes of the cached  vnode  recall that mounting a remote file system on top of another already  mounted remote file system a cascading mount is allowed in some imple\\xad mentations of nfs however a server cannot act as an intermediary between a  client and another server instead a client must establish a direct client server  comection with the second server by directly mounting the desired directory  when a client has a cascading mount more than one server can be involved in a  path name traversal however each component lookup is performed between  the original client and some server therefore when a client does a lookup on  a directory on which the server has mounted a file system the client sees the  underlying directory instead of the mounted directory   remote operations  with the exception of opening and closing files there is almost a one to one  correspondence between the regular unix system calls for file operations and  the nfs protocol rpcs thus a remote file operation can be translated directly  to the corresponding rpc conceptually nfs adheres to the remote service  paradigm but in practice buffering and caching techniques are employed for  the sake of performance no direct correspondence exists between a remote  operation and an rpc instead file blocks and file attributes are fetched by the  rpcs and are cached locally future remote operations use the cached data  subject to consistency constraints  there are two caches the file attribute inode infonnation cache and the  file blocks cache when a file is opened the kernel checks with the remote  server to determine whether to fetch or revalidate the cached attributes the  cached file blocks are used only if the corresponding cached attributes are up  to date the attribute cache is updated whenever new attributes arrive from  the server cached attributes are by default discarded after seconds both  read ahead and delayed write techniques are used between the server and the  client clients do not free delayed write blocks until the server confirms that  the data have been written to disk delayed write is retained even when a file  is opened concurrently in conflicting modes hence unix semantics section    are not preserved  tuning the system for performance makes it difficult to characterize the  consistency semantics of nfs new files created on a machine may not be  visible elsewhere for seconds furthermore writes to a file at one site may  or may not be visible at other sites that have this file open for reading new  opens of a file observe only the changes that have already been flushed to the  server thus nfs provides neither strict emulation of unix semantics nor the   chapter   session sen antics of andrew section  ln spite of these drawbacks the  utility and good performance of the mechanism make it the most widely used  multi vendor distributed system in operation  disk i o has a huge impact on system performance as a result file system  design and implementation command quite a lot of attention from system  designers some file systems are general purpose in that they can provide  reasonable performance and functionality for a wide variety of file sizes file  types and i loads others are optimized for specific tasks in an attempt to  provide better performance in those areas than general purpose file systems  the wafl file system from network appliance is an example of this sort of  optimization wafl the write anywhere file layout is a powerful elegant file  system optimized for random writes  wafl is used exclusively on network file servers produced by network  appliance and so is meant for use as a distributed file system it can provide  files to clients via the nfs cifs ftp and http protocols although it was  designed just for nfs and cifs when many clients use these protocols to talk  to a file server the server may see a very large demand for random reads and  an even larger demand for random writes the nfs and cifs protocols cache  data from read operations so writes are of the greatest concern to file server  creators  wafl is used on file servers that include an nvram cache for writes  the wafl designers took advantage of running on a specific architecture to  optimize the file system for random i with a stable storage cache in front  ease of use is one of the guiding principles of wafl because it is designed  to be used in an appliance its creators also designed it to include a new  snapshot functionality that creates multiple read only copies of the file system  at different points in time as we shall see  the file system is similar to the berkeley fast file system with many  modifications it is block based and uses inodes to describe files each inode  contains pointers to blocks or indirect blocks belonging to the file described  by the inode each file system has a root inode all of the metadata lives in  files all inodes are in one file the free block map in another and the free inode  root inode  · free blotk map i  figure the wafl file layout    map in a third as shown in figure because these are standard files the  data blocks are not limited in location and can be placed anywhere if a file  system is expanded by addition of disks the lengths of the metadata files are  automatically expanded by the file systen  thus a wafl file system is a tree of blocks with the root inode as its  base to take a snapshot wafl creates a copy of the root inode any file or  metadata updates after that go to new blocks rather than overwriting their  existing blocks the new root inode points to metadata and data changed as a  result of these writes meanwhile the snapshot the old root inode still points  to the old blocks which have not been updated it therefore provides access to  the file system just as it was at the instant the snapshot was made and takes  very little disk space to do so in essence the extra disk space occupied by a  snapshot consists of just the blocks that have been modified since the snapshot  was taken  an important change from more standard file systems is that the free block  map has more than one bit per block it is a bitmap with a bit set for each  snapshot that is using the block when all snapshots that have been using the  block are deleted the bit map for that block is all zeros and the block is free to  be reused used blocks are never overwritten so writes are very fast because  a write can occur at the free block nearest the current head location there are  many other performance optimizations in wafl as well  many snapshots can exist simultaneously so one can be taken each hour  of the day and each day of the month a user with access to these snapshots  can access files as they were at any of the times the snapshots were taken  the snapshot facility is also useful for backups testing versioning and so on  wafl s snapshot facility is very efficient in that it does not even require that  copy on write copies of each data block be taken before the block is modified  other file systems provide snapshots but frequently with less efficiency wafl  snapshots are depicted in figure  newer versions of wafl actually allow read write snapshots known as  clones are also efficient using the same techniques as shapshots in  this case a read only snapshot captures the state of the file system and a clone  refers back to that read only snapshot any writes to the clone are stored in  new blocks and the clone s pointers are updated to refer to the new blocks  the original snapshot is unmodified still giving a view into the file system as  it was before the clone was updated clones can also be promoted to replace  the original file system this involves throwing out all of the old pointers and  any associated old blocks clones are useful for testing and upgrades as the  original version is left untouched and the clone deleted when the test is done  or if the upgrade fails  another feature that naturally falls from the wafl file system implementa\\xad tion is the duplication and synchronization of a set of data over a  network to another system first a snapshot of a wafl file system is duplicated  to another system when another snapshot is taken on the source system it  is relatively easy to update the remote system just by sending over all blocks  contained in the new snapshot these blocks are the ones that have changed  between the times the two snapshots were taken the remote system adds these  blocks to the file system and updates its pointers and the new system then is a  duplicate of the source system as of the time of the second snapshot repeating  this process maintains the remote system as a nearly up to date copy of the first   chapter   a before a snapshot   b after a snapshot before any blocks change   c after block d has changed to o·  figure snapshots in wafl  system such replication is used for disaster recovery should the first system  be destroyed most of its data are available for use on the remote system  finally we should note that sun s zfs file system supports similarly  efficient snapshots clones and replication  the file system resides permanently on secondary storage which is designed to  hold a large amount of data permanently the most common secondary storage  medium is the disk  physical disks may be segmented into partitions to control media use  and to allow multiple possibly varying file systems on a single spindle  these file systems are mounted onto a logical file system architecture to make  then available for use file systems are often implemented in a layered or  modular structure the lower levels deal with the physical properties of storage  devices upper levels deal with symbolic file names and logical properties of  files intermediate levels map the logical file concepts into physical device  properties  any file system type can have different structures and algorithms a vfs  layer allows the upper layers to deal with each file system type uniformly even    remote file systems can be integrated into the system s directory structure and  acted on by standard system calls via the vfs interface  the various files can be allocated space on the disk in three ways  through contiguous linked or indexed allocation contiguous allocation can  suffer from external fragmentation direct access is very inefficient with  linked allocation indexed allocation may require substantial overhead for its  index block these algorithms can be optimized in many ways contiguous  space can be enlarged through extents to increase flexibility and to decrease  external fragmentation indexed allocation can be done in clusters of multiple  blocks to increase throughput and to reduce the number of index entries  needed indexing in large clusters is similar to contiguous allocation with  extents  free space allocation methods also influence the efficiency of disk space  use the performance of the file system and the reliability of secondary storage  the methods used include bit vectors and linked lists optimizations include  grouping countilcg and the fat which places the linked list in one contiguous  area  directory management routines must consider efficiency performance  and reliability a hash table is a commonly used method as it is fast and  efficient unfortunately damage to the table or a system crash can result  in inconsistency between the directory information and the disk s contents  a consistency checker can be used to repair the damage operating system  backup tools allow disk data to be copied to tape enabling the user to recover  from data or even disk loss due to hardware failure operating system bug or  user error  network file systems such as nfs use client server methodology to  allow users to access files and directories from remote machines as if they  were on local file systems system calls on the client are translated into  network protocols and retranslated into file system operations on the server  networking and multiple client access create challenges in the areas of data  consistency and performance  due to the fundamental role that file systems play in system operation  their performance and reliability are crucial techniques such as log structures  and cachirtg help improve performance while log structures and raid improve  reliability the wafl file system is an example of optimization of performance  to match a specific i o load

memory failure   one problem with contiguous allocation is that the user must preallo\\xad cate enough space for each file if the file grows to be larger than the  space allocated for it special actions must be taken one solution to this  problem is to define a file structure consisting of an initial contiguous  area of a specified size if this area is filled the operating system

secondary and tertiary storage  structures we first describe the physical structure of magenetic disks and  magnetic tapes we then describe disk scheduling algorithms which schedule  the order of disk

physical structure of secondary and tertiary storage  devices and its effects on the uses of the devices  to explain the performance characteristics of mass storage devices  to discuss operating system services provided for mass storage including  raid and hsm  in this section we present a general overview of the physical structure of  secondary and tertiary storage devices   magnetic disks  provide the bulk of secondary storage for modern computer  systems conceptually disks are relatively simple figure  each disk  platter has a flat circular shape like a cd common platter diameters range     chapter  arm assembly  rotation  figure moving head disk mechanism  from to inches the two surfaces of a platter are covered with a magnetic  material we store information by recording it magnetically on the platters  a read write head flies just above each surface of every platter the  heads are attached to a that moves all the heads as a unit the surface  of a platter is logically divided into circular which are subdivided into  the set of tracks that are at one arm position makes up a  there may be thousands of concentric cylinders in a disk drive and each track  may contain hundreds of sectors the storage capacity of common disk drives  is measured iil gigabytes  when the disk is in use a drive motor spins it at high speed most drives  rotate to times per second disk speed has two parts the  is the rate at which data flow between the drive and the computer the  sometimes called the consists of the  time necessary to move the disk arm to the desired cylinder called the  and the time necessary for the desired sector to rotate to the disk head  called the typical disks can transfer several megabytes of  data per second and they seek times and rotational latencies of several  milliseconds  because the disk head flies on an extremely thin cushion of air measured  in microns there is a danger that the head will make contact with the disk  surface although the disk platters are coated with a thin protective layer the  head will sometimes damage the magnetic surface this accident is called a  a head crash normally cannot be repaired the entire disk must be  replaced  a disk can be allowing different disks to be mounted as needed  removable magnetic disks generally consist of one platter held in a plastic case  to prevent damage while not in the disk drive are inexpensive  removable magnetic disks that have a soft plastic case containing a flexible  platter the head of a floppy disk drive generally sits directly on the disk    disk transfer rates  as with many aspects of computingf published performance numbers for  disks are not the same as real world performance numbers stated transfer  rates are always lower than for example the transfer  rate may be the rate at which bits can be read from the magnetic media by  the disk head but that is different from the rate at which blocks are delivered  to the operating system  surface so the drive is designed to rotate more slowly than a hard disk drive  to reduce the wear on the disk surface the storage capacity of a floppy disk  is typically only mb or so removable disks are available that work much  like normal hard disks and have capacities measured in gigabytes  a disk drive is attached to a computer by a set of wires called an  several kinds of buses are available including  buses the data transfers on a bus are carried out by special  electronic processors called the is the controller at  the computer end of the bus a is built into each disk drive to  perform a disk i operation the computer places a command into the host  controller typically using memory mapped i portsf as described in section   the host controller then sends the command via messages to the disk  controller and the disk controller operates the disk drive hardware to carry  out the command disk controllers usually have a built in cache data transfer  at the disk drive happens between the cache and the disk surface and data  transfer to the host at fast electronic speeds occurs between the cache and the  host controller   magnetic tapes  was used as an early secondary storage medium although it  is relatively permanent and can hold large quantities of dataf its access time  is slow compared with that of main memory and magnetic disk in addition  random access to magnetic tape is about a thousand times slower than random  access to magnetic disk so tapes are not very useful for secondary storage  tapes are used mainly for backup for storage of infrequently used information  and as a medium for transferring information from one system to another  a tape is kept in a spool and is wound or rewound past a read write head  moving to the correct spot on a tape can take minutes but once positioned  tape drives can write data at speeds comparable to disk drives tape capacities  vary greatly depending on the particular kind of tape drive typically they  store from gb to gb some have built in compression that can more than  double the effective storage tapes and their drivers are usually categorized  by width includil g f and millimeters and and inch some are  named according to technology such as lt and sdlt tape storage is further  described in section   chapter   fire wire  refers to an interface designed for connecting peripheral devices  such as hard drives dvd drives and digital video cameras to a computer  system fire wire was first developed by apple computer and became  the ieee standard in the originalfirewire standard provided  bandwidth up to megabits per second recently a new standard\\xad firewire has emerged and is identified by the ieee b standard  firewire provides double the data rate of the original firewire  megabits per second  modern disk drives are addressed as large one dimensional arrays of  where the logical block is the smallest unit of transfer the size of  a logical block is usually bytes although some disks can be  to have a different logical block size such as bytes this option  is described in section  the one dimensional array of logical blocks is  mapped onto the sectors of the disk sequentially sector is the first sector  of the first track on the outermost cylinder the mapping proceeds in order  through that track then through the rest of the tracks in that cylinder and then  through the rest of the cylinders from outermost to innermost  by using this mapping we can at least in theory convert a logical block  number into an old style disk address that consists of a cylinder number a track  number within that cylinder and a sector number within that track in practice  it is difficult to perform this translation for two reasons first most disks have  some defective sectors but the mapping hides this by substituting spare sectors  from elsewhere on the disk second the number of sectors per track is not a  constant on smne drives  let s look more closely at the second reason on media that use  the density of bits per track is uniform the farther a track  is from the center of the disk the greater its length so the more sectors it can  hold as we move from outer zones to inner zones the number of sectors per  track decreases tracks in the outermost zone typically hold percent more  sectors than do tracks in the innermost zone the drive increases its rotation  speed as the head moves from the outer to the inner tracks to keep the same rate  of data moving under the head this method is used in cd rom and dvd rom  drives alternatively the disk rotation speed can stay constant in this case the  density of bits decreases from inner tracks to outer tracks to keep the data rate  constant this method is used in hard disks and is known as  the number of sectors per track has been increasing as disk technology  improves and the outer zone of a disk usually has several hundred sectors per  track similarly the number of cylinders per disk has been increasing large  disks have tens of thousands of cylinders     computers access disk storage in two ways one way is via i o ports or  this is common on small systems the other way is via  a remote host in a distributed file system this is referred to as   host attached storage  host attached storage is storage accessed through local i ports these ports  use several technologies the typical desktop pc uses an i bus architecture  called ide or ata this architecture supports a maximum of two drives per i  bus a newer similar protocol that has simplified cabling is sata high end  workstations and servers generally use more sophisticated i architectures  such as scsi and fiber charmel fc  scsi is a bus architecture its physical medium is usually a ribbon cable with  a large number of conductors typically or the scsi protocol supports a  maximum of devices per bus generally the devices include one controller  card in the host the and up to storage devices the  to rgr ts a scsi disk is a common scsi target but the protocol provides the  ability to address up to in each scsi target a typical use of  logical unit addressing is to commands to components of a raid array  or components of a removable media library such as a cd jukebox sendil g  commands to the media changer mechanism or to one of the drives  fc is a high speed serial architecture that can operate over optical fiber or  over a four conductor copper cable it has two variants one is a large switched  fabric having a bit address space this variant is expected to dominate  in the future and is the basis of sjld s discussed in  section  because of the large space and the switched nature of  the communication multiple hosts and storage devices can attach to the fabric  allowing great flexibility in i communication the other fc variant is an  that can address devices drives and controllers  a wide variety of storage devices are suitable for use as host attached  storage among these are hard disk drives raid arrays and cd dvd and  tape drives the i commands that initiate data transfers to a host attached  storage device are reads and writes of logical data blocks directed to specifically  identified storage units such as bus id scsi id and target logical unit   network attached storage  a network attached storage nas device is a special purpose storage system  that is accessed remotely over a data network figure  clients access  network attached storage via a remote procedure call interface such as nfs  for unix systems or cifs for windows machines the remote procedure calls   rpcs are carried via tcp or udp over an ip network usually the same  local area network lan that carries all data traffic to the clients the network\\xad attached storage unit is usually implemented as a raid array with software that  implements the rpc interface it is easiest to thil k of nas as simply another  storage access protocol for example rather than using a scsi device driver  and scsi protocols to access storage a system using nas would use rpc over  tcp ip   chapter   lan wan  figure network attached storage  network attached storage provides a convenient way for all the computers  on a lan to share a pool of storage with the same ease of naming and access  enjoyed with local host attached storage however it tends to be less efficient  and have lower performance than some direct attached storage options  is the latest network attached storage protocol in essence it uses the  ip network protocol to carry the scsi protocol thus networks rather than  scsi cables can be used as the interconnects between hosts and their storage  as a result hosts can treat their storage as if it were directly attached even if  the storage is distant from the host   storage area network  one drawback of network attached storage systems is that the storage i o  operations consume bandwidth on the data network thereby increasing the  latency of network communication this problem can be particularly acute  in large client server installations the communication between servers and  clients competes for bandwidth with the communication among servers and  storage devices  a storage area network san is a private network using storage protocols  rather than networking protocols connecting servers and storage units as  shown in figure the power of a san lies in its flexibility multiple hosts  and multiple storage arrays can attach to the same san and storage can  be dynamically allocated to hosts a san switch allows or prohibits access  between the hosts and the storage as one example if a host is running low  on disk space the san can be configured to allocate more storage to that host  sans make it possible for clusters of servers to share the same storage and for  storage arrays to include multiple direct host com ections sans typically have  more ports and less expensive ports than storage arrays  fc is the most common san interconnect although the simplicity of iscsi is  increasing its use an emerging alternative is a special purpose bus architecture  named infiniband which provides hardware and software support for high\\xad speed interconnection networks for servers and storage units  one of the responsibilities of the operating system is to use the hardware  efficiently for the disk drives meeting this responsibility entails having    figure storage area network  fast access time and large disk bandwidth the access time has two major  components also see section  the is the time for the disk arm  to move the heads to the cylinder containing the desired sector the  is the additional time for the disk to rotate the desired sector to the disk  head the disk is the total number of bytes transferred divided  by the total time between the first request for service and the completion of  the last transfer we can improve both the access time and the bandwidth by  managing the order in which disk i o requests are serviced  whenever a process needs i to or from the disk it issues a system call to  the operating system the request specifies several pieces of information  whether this operation is input or output  what the disk address for the transfer is  what the memory address for the transfer is  what the number of sectors to be transferred is  if the desired disk drive and controller are available the request can be  serviced immediately if the drive or controller is busy any new requests  for service will be placed in the queue of pending requests for that drive  for a multiprogramming system with many processes the disk queue may  often have several pending requests thus when one request is completed the  operating system chooses which pending request to service next how does  the operating system make this choice any one of several disk scheduling  algorithms can be used and we discuss them next   fcfs scheduling  the simplest form of disk scheduling is of course the first come first served   fcfs algorithm this algorithm is intrinsically fair but it generally does not  provide the fastest service consider for example a disk queue with requests  for i to blocks on cylinders        chapter  queue    head starts at     figure fcfs disk scheduling  in that order if the disk head is initially at cylinder it will first move from   to then to    and finally to for a total head  movement of cylinders this schedule is diagrammed in figure  the wild swing from to and then back to illustrates the problem  with this schedule if the requests for cylinders and could be serviced  together before or after the requests for and the total head movement  could be decreased substantially and performance could be thereby improved   sstf scheduling  it seems reasonable to service all the requests close to the current head position  before moving the head far to service other this assumption is  the basis for the the sstf algorithm  selects the request with the least seek time from the current head position  since seek time increases with the number of cylinders traversed by the head  sstf chooses the pending request closest to the current head position  for our example request queue the closest request to the initial head  position is at cylinder once we are at cylinder the next closest  request is at cylinder from there the request at cylinder is closer than the  one at so is served next continuing we service the request at cylinder  then  and finally figure  this scheduling method results  in a total head movement of only cylinders little more than one third  of the distance needed for fcfs scheduling of this request queue clearly this  algorithm gives a substantial improvement in performance  sstf scheduling is essentially a form of shortest job first sjf scheduling  and like sjf scheduling it may cause starvation of some requests remember  that requests may arrive at any time suppose that we have two requests in  the queue for cylinders and and while the request from is being  serviced a new request near arrives this new request will be serviced  next making the request at wait while this request is being serviced  another request close to could arrive in theory a continual stream of requests  near one another could cause the request for cylinder to wait indefinitely    queue      head starts at     figure sstf disk scheduling    this scenario becomes increasingly likely as the pending request queue grows  longer  although the sstf algorithm is a substantial improvement over the fcfs  algorithm it is not optimal in the example we can do better by moving the  head from to even though the latter is not closest and then to before  turning around to service   and this strategy reduces  the total head movement to cylinders   scan scheduling  in the  toward the end servicing requests as it reaches each cylinder until it gets  to the other end of the disk at the other end the direction of head movement  is reversed and servicing continues the head continuously scans back and  forth across the disk the scan algorithm is sometimes called the  since the disk arm behaves just like an elevator in a building first  servicing all the requests going up and then reversing to service requests the  other way  let s return to our example to illustrate before applying scan to schedule  the requests on cylinders    and we need to know  the direction of head movement in addition to the head s current position  assuming that the disk arm is moving toward and that the initial head  position is again the head will next service and then at cylinder  the arm will reverse and will move toward the other end of the disk servicil lg  the requests at   and figure  if a request arrives  in the queue just in front of the head it will be serviced almost immediately a  request arriving just behind the head will have to wait until the arm moves to  the end of the disk reverses direction and comes back  assuming a uniform distribution of requests for cylinders consider the  density of requests when the head reaches one end and reverses direction at  this point relatively few requests are immediately in front of the head since  these cylinders have recently been serviced the heaviest density of requests   chapter  queue    head starts at     figure scan disk scheduling  is at the other end of the disk these requests have also waited the longest so  why not go there first that is the idea of the next algorithm   c scan scheduling  is a variant of scan designed to provide  a more uniform wait time like scan c scan moves the head from one end  of the disk to the other servicing requests along the way when the head  reaches the other end however it immediately returns to the beginning of  the disk without servicing any requests on the return trip figure  the  c scan scheduling algorithm essentially treats the cylinders as a circular list  that wraps around from the final cylinder to the first one  queue      head starts at      figure c scan disk scheduling    queue      head starts at     figure c look disk scheduling   look scheduling    as we described themf both scan and c scan move the disk arm across the  full width of the disk in practicef neither algorithm is often implemented this  way more commonlyf the arm goes only as far as the final request in each  direction then it reverses direction immediatelyf without going all the way to  the end of the disk versions of scan and c scan that follow this pattern are  called and because they look for a request before  continuing to move in a given direction figure    selection of a disk scheduling algorithm  given so many disk scheduling algorithmsf how do we choose the best one  sstf is common and has a natural appeal because it increases performance over  fcfs scan and c scan perform better for systems that place a heavy load on  the diskf because they are less likely to cause a starvation problem for any  particular list of requestsf we can define an optimal order of retrievat but the  computation needed to find an optimal schedule may not justify the savings  over sstf or scan with any scheduling algoritlunf howeverf performance  depends heavily on the number and types of requests for instance suppose  that the queue usually has just one outstanding request thenf all scheduling  algorithms behave the samef because they have only one choice of where to  move the disk head they all behave like fcfs scheduling  requests for disk service can be greatly influenced by the file allocation  method a program reading a contiguously allocated file will generate several  requests that are close together on the disk resulting in limited head movement  a linked or indexed fik in contrastf may include blocks that are widely  scattered on the diskf resulting in greater head movement  the location of directories and index blocks is also important since every  file must be opened to be usedf and opening a file requires searching the  directory structuref the directories will be accessed frequently suppose that a  directory entry is on the first cylinder and a filef s data are on the final cylinder in  this casef the disk head has to move the entire width of the disk if the directory   chapter   entry were on the middle cylinder the head would have to move only one half  the width caching the directories and index blocks in main memory can also  help to reduce disk arm movement particularly for read requests  because of these complexities the disk scheduling algorithm should be  written as a separate module of the operating system so that it can be replaced  with a different algorithm if necessary either sstf or look is a reasonable  choice for the default algorithm  the scheduling algorithms described here consider only the seek distances  for modern disks the rotational latency can be nearly as large as the  average seek time it is difficult for the operating system to schedule for  improved rotational latency though because modern disks do not disclose the  physical location of logical blocks disk manufacturers have been alleviating  this problem by implementing disk scheduling algorithms in the controller  hardware built into the disk drive if the operating system sends a batch of  requests to the controller the controller can queue them and then schedule  them to improve both the seek time and the rotational latency  if i o performance were the only consideration the operating system  would gladly turn over the responsibility of disk scheduling to the disk hard\\xad ware in practice however the operating system may have other constraints on  the service order for requests for instance demand paging may take priority  over application i and writes are more urgent than reads if the cache is  running out of free pages also it may be desirable to guarantee the order of a  set of disk writes to make the file system robust in the face of system crashes  consider what could happen if the operating system allocated a disk page to a  file and the application wrote data into that page before the operating system  had a chance to flush the modified inode and free space list back to disk to  accommodate such requirements an operating system may choose to do its  own disk scheduling and to spoon feed the requests to the disk controller one  by one for some types of i  the operating system is responsible for several other aspects of disk manage\\xad ment too here we discuss disk initialization booting from disk and bad block  recovery   disk formatting  a new magnetic disk is a blank slate it is just a platter of a magnetic recording  material before a disk can store data it must be divided into sectors that the  disk controller can read and write this process is called  or low level formatting fills the disk with a special data  structure for each sector the data structure for a sector typically consists of a  header a data area usually bytes in size and a trailer the header and  trailer contain information used by the disk controller such as a sector number  and an when the controller writes a sector of data  during normal i the ecc is updated with a value calculated from all the bytes  in the data area when the sector is read the ecc is recalculated and compared  with the stored value if the stored and calculated numbers are different this    mismatch indicates that the data area of the sector has become corrupted and  that the disk sector may be bad section  the ecc is an error correcting  code because it contains enough information if only a few bits of data have  been corrupted to enable the controller to identify which bits have changed  and calculate what their correct values should be it then reports a recoverable   the controller automatically does the ecc processing whenever a  sector is read or written  most hard disks are low level formatted at the factory as a part of the  manufacturing process this formatting enables the manufacturer to test the  disk and to initialize the mapping from logical block numbers to defect free  sectors on the disk for many hard disks when the disk controller is instructed  to low level format the disk it can also be told how many bytes of data space  to leave between the header and trailer of all sectors it is usually possible to  choose among a few sizes such as and bytes formatting a disk  with a larger sector size means that fewer sectors can fit on each track but it  also means that fewer headers and trailers are written on each track and more  space is available for user data some operating systems can handle only a  sector size of bytes  before it can use a disk to hold files the operating system still needs to  record its own data structures on the disk it does so in two steps the first step  is to the disk into one or more groups of cylinders the operatiltg  system can treat each partition as though it were a separate disk for instance  one partition can hold a copy of the operating system s executable code while  another holds user files the second step is icgicz i or creation of a  file system in this step the operating system stores the iltitial file system data  structures onto the disk these data structures may include maps of free and  allocated space a fat or inodes and an initial empty directory  to increase efficiency most file systems group blocks together into larger  chunks frequently called disk i is done via blocks but file system  ii is done via clusters effectively assuring that ii has more sequential access  and fewer random access characteristics  some operating systems give special programs the ability to use a disk  partition as a large sequential array of logical blocks without any file system  data structures this array is sometimes called the raw disk and ii to this array  is termed raw l for example some database systems prefer raw iio because  it enables them to control the exact disk location where each database record is  stored raw l bypasses all the file system services such as the buffer cache  file locking prefetching space allocation file names and directories we can  make certain applications more efficient by allowing them to implement their  own special purpose storage services on a raw partition but most applications  perform better when they use the regular file system services   boot block  for a computer to start running for instance when it is powered up  or rebooted it must have an initial program to run this initial bootstrap  program tends to be simple it initializes all aspects of the system from cpu  registers to device controllers and the contents of main memory and then  starts the operating system to do its job the bootstrap program finds the   chapter  operating system kernel on disk loads that kernel into memory and jumps to  an initial address to begin the operating system execution  for most computers the bootstrap is stored in  this location is convenient because rom needs no initialization and is at a fixed  location that the processor can start executing when powered up or reset and  since rom is read only it cannot be infected by a computer virus the problem is  that changing this bootstrap code requires changing the rom hardware chips  for this reason most systems store a tiny bootstrap loader program in the boot  rom whose only job is to bring in a full bootstrap program from disk the full  bootstrap program can be changed easily a new version is simply written onto  the disk the full bootstrap program is stored in the boot blocks at a fixed  location on the disk a disk that has a boot partition is called a or  the code in the boot rom instructs the disk controller to read the boot  blocks into memory no device drivers are loaded at this point and then starts  executing that code the full bootstrap program is more sophisticated than the  bootstrap loader in the boot rom it is able to load the entire operating system  from a non fixed location on disk and to start the operating system ruruing  even so the full bootstrap code may be small  let s consider as an example the boot process in windows the  windows system places its boot code in the first sector on the hard disk   which it terms the or furthermore windows  allows a hard disk to be divided into one or more partitions one partition  identified as the contains the operating system and device  drivers bootilg begins in a windows system by running code that is  resident in the system s rom memory this code directs the system to read  the boot code from the mbr in addition to containing boot code the mbr  contains a table listing the partitions for the hard disk and a flag indicating  which partition the system is to be booted from as illustrated in figure  once the system identifies the boot partition it reads the first sector from that  partition which is called the and contilmes with the remainder of  the boot process which includes loading the various subsystems and system  services  mbr  partition  partition  partition  partition boot  code  partition  table  boot partition  figure booting from disk in windows     bad blocks  because disks have moving parts and small tolerances recall that the disk  head flies just above the disk surface they are prone to failure sometimes the  failure is complete in this case the disk needs to be replaced and its contents  restored from backup media to the new disk more frequently one or more  sectors become defective most disks even con le from the factory with  depending on the disk and controller in use these blocks are handled  in a variety of ways  on simple disks such as some disks with ide controllers bad blocks are  handled manually for instance the ms dos format command performs logical  formatting and as a part of the process scans the disk to find bad blocks if  format finds a bad block it writes a special value into the corresponding fat  entry to tell the allocation routines not to use that block if blocks go bad during  normal operation a special program such as chkdsk must be run manually  to search for the bad blocks and to lock them away data that resided on the  bad blocks usually are lost  more sophisticated disks such as the scsi disks used in high end pcs  and most workstations and servers are smarter about bad block recovery the  controller maintains a list of bad blocks on the disk the list is initialized during  the low level formatting at the factory and is updated over the life of the disk  low level formatting also sets aside spare sectors not visible to the operating  system the controller can be told to replace each bad sector logically with one  of the spare sectors this scheme is known as or  a typical bad sector transaction might be as follows  the operating system tries to read logical block  the controller calculates the ecc and finds that the sector is bad it reports  this finding to the operating system  the next time the system is rebooted a special command is run to tell the  scsi controller to replace the bad sector with a spare  after that whenever the system requests logical block the request is  translated into the replacement sector s address by the controller  note that such a redirection by the controller could invalidate any opti\\xad mization by the operating system s disk scheduling algorithm for this reason  most disks are formatted to provide a few spare sectors in each cylinder and  a spare cylinder as well when a bad block is remapped the controller uses a  spare sector from the same cylinder if possible  as an alternative to sector some controllers can be instructed to  replace a bad block by here is an example suppose that  logical block becomes defective and the first available spare follows sector   then sector slipping remaps all the sectors front to moving them  all down one spot that is sector is copied into the spare then sector  into then into and so on until sector is copied into sector  slipping the sectors in this way frees up the space of sector so sector can  be mapped to it  the replacement of a bad block generally is not totally automatic because  the data in the bad block are usually lost soft errors may trigger a process in   chapter   which a copy of the block data is made and the block is spared or slipped  an unrecoverable howeverf results in lost data whatever file was  using th at block must be repaired for instancef by restoration from a backup  tape f and that requires manual intervention  swapping was first presented in section f where we discussed moving  entire processes between disk and main memory swapping in that setting  occurs when the amount of physical memory reaches a critically low point and  processes are moved from memory to swap space to free available memory  in practicef very few modern operating systems implement swapping in  this fashion ratheh systems now combine swapping with virtual memory  techniques chapter and swap pagesf not necessarily entire processes in  fact some systems now use the terms swapping and paging interchangeablyf  reflecting the merging of these two concepts  is another low level task of the operating  system virtual memory uses disk space as an extension of main memory  since disk access is much slower than memory accessf using swap space  significantly decreases system performance the main goal for the design and  implementation of swap space is to provide the best throughput for the virtual  memory system in this sectionf we discuss how swap space is usedf where  swap space is located on diskf and how swap space is managed   swap space use  swap space is used in various ways by different operating systemsf depending  on the memory management algorithms in use for instancef systems that  implement swapping may use swap space to hold an entire process imagef  including the code and data segments paging systems may simply store pages  that have been pushed out of main memory the amount of swap space needed  on a system can therefore vary from a few megabytes of disk space to gigabytesf  depending on the amow t of physical memoryf the amount of virtual memory  it is backingf and the way in which the virtual memory is used  note that it may be safer to overestimate than to underestimate the amount  of swap space requiredf because if a system runs out of swap space it may be  forced to abort processes or may crash entirely overestimation wastes disk  space that could otherwise be used for filesf but it does no other harm some  systems recommend the amount to be set aside for swap space solarisf for  examplef suggests setting swap space equal to the amount by which virtual  memory exceeds pageable physical memory in the past linux has suggested  setting swap space to double the amount of physical memoryf although most  linux systems now use considerably less swap space in factf there is currently  much debate in the linux community about whether to set aside swap space  at all  some operating systems including linux allow the use of multiple  swap spaces these swap spaces are usually put on separate disks so that the  load placed on the i system by paging and swapping can be spread over the  systemfs i o devices     swap space location  a swap space can reside in one of two places it can be carved out of the  normal file system or it can be in a separate disk partition if the swap space  is simply a large file within the file system normal file system routines can be  used to create it name it and allocate its space this approach though easy  to implement is inefficient navigating the directory structure and the disk\\xad allocation data structures takes time and possibly extra disk accesses external  fragmentation can greatly increase swapping times by forcing multiple seeks  during reading or writing of a process image we can improve performance  by caching the block location information in physical memory and by using  special tools to allocate physically contiguous blocks for the swap file but the  cost of traversing the file system data structures remains  alternatively swap space can be created in a separate partition no  file system or directory structure is placed in this space rather a separate  swap space storage manager is used to allocate and deallocate the blocks  from the raw partition this manager uses algorithms optimized for speed  rather than for storage efficiency because swap space is accessed much more  frequently than file systems when it is used internal fragmentation may  increase but this trade off is acceptable because the life of data in the swap  space generally is much shorter than that of files in the file system since  swap space is reinitialized at boot time any fragmentation is short lived the  raw partition approach creates a fixed amount of swap space during disk  partitioning adding more swap space requires either repartitioning the disk   which involves moving the other file system partitions or destroying them  and restoring them from backup or adding another swap space elsewhere  some operating systems are flexible and can swap both in raw partitions  and in file system space linux is an example the policy and implementation  are separate allowing the machine s administrator to decide which type of  swapping to use the trade off is between the convenience of allocation and  management in the file system and the performance of swapping in raw  partitions   swap space management an example  we can illustrate how swap space is used by following the evolution of  swapping and paging in various unix systems the traditional unix kernel  started with an implementation of swapping that copied entire processes  between contiguous disk regions and memory unix later evolved to a  combination of swapping and paging as pagiltg hardware became available  in solaris sunos the designers changed standard unix methods to  improve efficiency and reflect technological developments when a process  executes text segment pages containing code are brought in from the file  system accessed in main memory and thrown away if selected for pageout it  is more efficient to reread a page from the file system than to write it to swap  space and then reread it from there swap space is only used as a backing store  for pages of memory which includes memory allocated for the  stack heap and uninitialized data of a process  more changes were made in later versions of solaris the biggest change  is that solaris now allocates swap space only when a page is forced out of  physical memory rather than when the virtual memory page is first created   chapter   swap partition  or swap file  swap map   swap area    page  i slot  l   l  l   figure the data structures for swapping on linux systems  this scheme gives better performance on modern computers which have more  physical memory than older systems and tend to page less  linux is similar to solaris in that swap space is only used for anonymous  memory or for regions of memory shared by several processes linux allows  one or more swap areas to be established a swap area may be in either a swap  file on a regular file system or a raw swap space partition each swap area  consists of a series of kb which are used to hold swapped pages  associated with each swap area is a u p an array of integer counters  each corresponding to a page slot in the swap area if the value of a counter is  the corresponding page slot is available values greater than indicate that the  page slot is occupied by a swapped page the value of the counter ij l dicates the  number of mappings to the swapped page for example a value of indicates  that the swapped page is mapped to three different processes which can occur  if the swapped page is storing a region of memory shared by three processes  the data structures for swapping on linux systems are shown in figure  disk drives have continued to get smaller and cheaper so it is now economi\\xad cally feasible to attach many disks to a computer system having a large number  of disks in a system presents opportunities for improving the rate at which data  can be read or written if the disks are operated in parallel furthermore this  setup offers the potential for improving the reliability of data storage because  redundant information can be stored on multiple disks thus failure of one disk  does not lead to loss of data a of disk organization techniques collec  tively called disks raids are commonly  used to address the performance and reliability issues  in the past raids composed of small cheap disks were viewed as a  cost effective alternative to large expensive disks today raids are used for  their higher reliability and higher data transfer rate rather than for economic  reasons hence the i in raid which once stood for inexpensive now stands  for ij l dependent   improvement of reliability via redundancy  let us first consider the reliability of raids the chance that some disk out of  a set of n disks will fail is much higher than the chance that a specific single    structuring raid  raid storage can be structured in a variety of ways for example a system  can have disks directly attached to its buses in this case the operating  system or system software can implement raid flmctionality alternatively  an intelligent host controller can control multiple attached disks and can  implement raid on those disks in hardware finally a or  can be used a raid array is a standalone unit with its own controller  cache usually and disks it is attached to the host via one or more standard  ata scsi or fc controllers this common setup allows any operating system  and software without raid functionality to have raid protected disks it  is even used on systems that do have raid software layers because of its  simplicity and flexibility  disk will fail suppose that the of a single disk is  hours then the mean time to failure of some disk in an array of disks  will be  hours or days which is not long at all if we  store only one copy of the data then each disk failure will result in loss of a  significant amount of data and such a high rate of data loss is unacceptable  the solution to the problem of reliability is to introduce we  store extra information that is not normally needed but that can be used in the  event of failure of a disk to rebuild the lost information thus even if a disk  fails data are not lost  the simplest but most expensive approach to introducing redundancy  is to duplicate every disk this technique is called with mirroring  a logical disk consists of two physical disks and every write is carried out  on both disks the result is called a mirrored volume if one of the disks in the  volume fails the data can be read from the other data will be lost only if the  second disk fails before the first failed disk is replaced  the mean time to failure of a mirrored volume where failure is the loss  of data depends on two factors one is the mean time to failure of the  individual disks the other is the which is the time it  takes on average to replace a failed disk and to restore the data on it suppose  that the failures of the two disks are that is the failure of one disk  is not connected to the failure of the other then if the mean time to failure of a  single disk is hours and the mean time to repair is hours the  of a mirrored disk system is      hours or years  you should be aware that the assumption of independence of disk failures  is not valid power failures and natural disasters such as earthquakes fires  and floods may result in damage to both disks at the same time also  manufacturing defects in a batch of disks can cause correlated failures as  disks age the probability of failure grows increasing the chance that a second  disk will fail while the first is being repaired in spite of all these considerations  however n irrored disk systems offer much higher reliability than do single\\xad disk systems  power failures are a particular source of concern since they occur far more  frequently than do natural disasters even with mirroring of disks if writes are   chapter  in progress to the same block in both disks and power fails before both blocks  are fully written the two blocks can be in an inconsistent state one solution  to this is to write one copy first then the next another is to add a  cache to the raid array this write back cache is  protected from data loss during power failures so the write can be considered  complete at that point assuming the nvram has some kind of error protection  and correction such as ecc or mirroring   improvement in performance via parallelism  now let s consider how parallel access to multiple disks improves perfor\\xad mance with disk mirroring the rate at which read requests can be handled is  doubled since read requests can be sent to either disk as long as both disks  in a pair are functionat as is almost always the case the transfer rate of each  read is the same as in a single disk system but the number of reads per unit  time has doubled  with multiple disks we can improve the transfer rate as well or instead  by striping data across the disks in its simplest form consists  of the bits of each byte across multiple disks such striping is called  for example if we have an array of eight disks we write bit  i of each byte to disk i the array of eight disks can be treated as a single disk  with sectors that are eight times the normal size and more important that have  eight times the access rate in such an organization every disk participates in  every access read or write so the number of accesses that can be processed  per second is about the same as on a single disk but each access can read eight  times as many data in the same time as on a single disk  bit level striping can be generalized to include a number of disks that either  is a multiple of or divides for example if we use an array of four disks  bits i and i of each go to disk i further striping need not occur at  the bit level in for instance blocks of a file are striped  across multiple disks with n disks block i of a file goes to disk i mod n   other levels of striping such as bytes of a sector or sectors of a block also are  possible block level striping is the most common  parallelism in a disk system as achieved through striping has two main  goals  increase the throughput of multiple small accesses that is page accesses  by load balancing  reduce the response time of large accesses   raid levels  mirroring provides high reliability but it is expensive striping provides high  data transfer rates but it does not improve reliability numerous schemes  to provide redundancy at lower cost by using disk striping combined with   parity bits which we describe next l ave been proposed these schemes  have different cost performance trade offs and are classified according to  levels called we describe the various levels here figure  shows them pictorially in the figure p indicates error correcting bits and c   raid structure   a raid non redundant striping   b raid mirrored disks   c raid memory style error correcting codes   d raid bit interleaved parity   e raid block interleaved parity   f raid block interleaved distributed parity   g raid p q redundancy  figure raid levels  indicates a second copy of the data in all cases depicted in the figure four  disks worth of data are stored and the extra disks are used to store redundant  information for failure recovery  • raid level raid level refers to disk arrays with striping at the level of  blocks but without any redundancy such as mirroring or parity bits as  shown in figure l a  • raid ievell raid level refers to disk mirroring figure l b shows  a mirrored organization   raid level raid level is also known as memory style error correcting\\xad code ecc organization memory systems have long detected certain  errors by using parity bits each byte in a memory system may have a  parity bit associated with it that records whether the number of bits in the  byte set to is even parity or odd parity  if one of the bits in the   chapter  byte is damaged either a becomes a or a becomes an the parity of  the byte changes and thus does not match the stored parity similarly if the  stored parity bit is damaged it does not match the computed parity thus  all single bit errors are detected by the menwry system error correcting  schemes store two or more extra bits and can reconstruct the data if a  single bit is damaged the idea of ecc can be ·used directly in disk arrays  via striping of bytes across disks for example the first bit of each byte can  be stored in disk the second bit in disk and so on until the eighth bit  is stored in disk the error correction bits are stored in further disks this  scheme is shown pictorially in figure l c where the disks labeled p  store the error correction bits if one of the disks fails the remaining bits  of the byte and the associated error correction bits can be read from other  disks and used to reconstruct the damaged data note that raid level  requires only three disks overhead for four disks of data unlike raid level   which requires four disks overhead  raid level raid level or  improves on level by taking into account the fact that unlike mem\\xad ory systems disk controllers can detect whether a sector has been read  correctly so a single parity bit can be used for error correction as well as  for detection the idea is as follows if one of the sectors is damaged we  know exactly which sector it is and we can figure out whether any bit in  the sector is a or a by computing the parity of the corresponding bits  from sectors in the other disks if the parity of the remaining bits is equal  to the stored parity the missing bit is otherwise it is raid level is as  good as level but is less expensive in the number of extra disks required   it has only a one disk overhead so level is not used in practice this  scheme is shown pictorially in figure l d  raid level has two advantages over level first the storage over\\xad head is reduced because only one parity disk is needed for several regular  disks whereas one mirror disk is needed for every disk in level second  since reads and writes of a byte are spread out over multiple disks with  n way striping of data the transfer rate for reading or writing a single  block is n times as fast as with raid level on the negative side raid  level supports fewer l os per second since every disk has to participate  in every i request  a further performance problem with raid and with all parity\\xad based raid levels is the expense of computing and writing the parity  this overhead results in significantly slower writes than with non parity  raid arrays to moderate this performance penalty many raid storage  arrays include a hardware controller with dedicated parity hardware this  controller offloads the parity computation from the cpu to the array the  array has an nvram cache as well to store the blocks while the parity is  computed and to buffer the writes from the controller to the spindles this  combination can make parity raid almost as fast as non parity in fact a  caching array doing parity raid can outperform a non caching non parity  raid  raid level raid level or uses  block level striping as in raid and in addition keeps a parity block on a  separate disk for corresponding blocks from n other disks this scheme is    diagramed in figure l e if one of the disks fails the parity block can  be used with the corresponding blocks from the other disks to restore the  blocks of the failed disk  a block read accesses only one disk allowing other requests to be  processed by the other disks thus the data transfer rate for each access  is slower but multiple read accesses can proceed in parallel leading to a  higher overall i rate the transfer rates for large reads are high since all  the disks can be read in parallel large writes also have high transfer rates  since the data and parity can be written in parallel  small independent writes cannot be performed in parallel an operating\\xad system write of data smaller than a block requires that the block be read  modified with the new data and written back the parity block has to be  updated as well this is known as the thus a  single write requires four disk accesses two to read the two old blocks and  two to write the two new blocks  wafl chapter uses raid level because this raid level allows disks  to be added to a raid set seamlessly if the added disks are initialized with  blocks containing all zeros then the parity value does not change and the  raid set is still correct  raid levels raid levels or differs  from level by spreading data and parity among all n disks rather  than storing data in n disks and parity in one disk for each block one of  the disks stores the parity and the others store data for example with an  array of five disks the parity for the nth block is stored in disk n mod   the nth blocks of the other four disks store actual data for that block this  setup is shown in figure f where the ps are distributed across all  the disks a parity block cannot store parity for blocks in the same disk  because a disk failure would result in loss of data as well as of parity and  hence the loss would not be recoverable by spreading the parity across  all the disks in the set raid avoids potential overuse of a single parity  disk which can occur with raid raid is the most common parity raid  system  raid level raid level also called the is  much like raid level but stores extra redundant information to guard  against disk failures instead of parity error correcting codes such  as the are used in the scheme shown in figure   g bits of redundant data are stored for every bits of data\\xad compared with parity bit in level and the system can tolerate two  disk failures  raid levels  and  raid level  refers to a combination of raid  levels and raid provides the performance while raid provides  the reliability generally this level provides better performance than raid   it is common in enviromnents where both performance and reliability  are important unfortunately like raid it doubles the number of disks  needed for storage so it is also relatively expensive in raid  a set  of disks are striped and then the stripe is mirrored to another equivalent  stripe   chapter  stripe a raid  with a single disk failure  a u  mirror  b raid  with a single disk failure  figure raid  and   another raid option that is becoming available commercially is raid  level  in which disks are mirrored in pairs and then the resulti j l g  mirrored pairs are striped this scheme has some theoretical advantages  over raid  for example if a single disk fails in raid  an entire  stripe is inaccessible leaving only the other stripe available with a failure  in raid  a single disk is unavailable but the disk that mirrors it is still  available as are all the rest of the disks figure   numerous variations have been proposed to the basic raid schemes described  here as a result some confusion may exist about the exact definitions of the  different raid levels  the implementation of raid is another area of variation consider the  following layers at which raid can be implemented  volume management software can implement raid within the kernel or  at the system software layer in this case the storage hardware can provide  a minimum of features and still be part of a full raid solution parity raid  is fairly slow when implemented in software so typically raid  or   is used  raid can be implemented in the host bus adapter hba hardware only  the disks directly connected to the hba can be part of a given raid set  this solution is low in cost but not very flexible    raid can be implemented in the hardware of the storage array the storage  array can create raid sets of various levels and can even slice these sets  into smaller volumes which are then presented to the operating system  the operating system need only implement the file system on each of the  volumes arrays can have multiple connections available or can be part of  a san allowing multiple hosts to take advantage of the array s features  raid can be implemented in the san interconnect layer by disk virtualiza\\xad tion devices in this case a device sits between the hosts and the storage  it accepts commands from the servers and manages access to the storage  it could provide mirroring for example by writing each block to two  separate storage devices  other features such as and replication can be implemented at  each of these levels as well involves the automatic duplication of  writes between separate sites for redundancy and disaster recovery replication  can be synchronous or asynchronous in synchronous replication each block  must be written locally and remotely before the write is considered complete  whereas in asynchronous replication the writes are grouped together and  written periodically asynchronous replication can result in data loss if the  primary site fails but it is faster and has no distance limitations  the implementation of these features differs depending on the layer at  which raid is implemented for example if raid is implemented in software  then each host may need to carry out and manage its own replication if  replication is implemented in the storage array or in the san intercomect  however then whatever the host operating system or its features the host s  data can be replicated  one other aspect of most raid implementations is a hot spare disk or disks  a is not used for data but is configured to be used as a replacement in  case disk failure for instance a hot spare can be used to rebuild a mirrored  pair should one of the disks in the pair fail in this way the raid level can be  reestablished automatically without waiting for the failed disk to be replaced  allocating more than one hot spare allows more than one failure to be repaired  without human intervention   selecting a raid level  given the many choices they have how do system designers choose a raid  level one consideration is rebuild performance if a disk fails the time needed  to rebuild its data can be significant this may be an important factor if a  continuous supply of data is required as it is in high performance or interactive  database systems furthermore rebuild performance influences the mean time  to failure  rebuild performance varies with the raid level used rebuilding is easiest  £or raid level since data can be copied from another disk for the other levels  we need to access all the other disks in the array to rebuild data in a failed disk  rebuild times can be hours for raid rebuilds of large disk sets  raid level is used in high performance applications where data loss is  not critical raid level is popular for applications that require high reliability  with fast recovery raid  and  are used where both performance and  reliability are important for example for small databases due to raid s   chapter  the inserv storage array  imovation in an effort to provide better faster and less expensive solutions  frequently blurs the lines that separated previous technologies consider the  inserv storage array from par unlike most other storage arrays inserv  does not require that a set of disks be configured at a specific raid level  rather each disk is broken into mb chunklets ram is then applied at  the chunklet level a disk can thus participate in multiple and various raid  levels as its chunklets are used for multiple volumes  inserv also provides snapshots similar to those created by the wafl file  system the format of inserv snapshots can be read write as well as read\\xad only allowing multiple hosts to mount copies of a given file system without  needing their own copies of the entire file system any changes a host makes  in its own copy are copy on write and so are not reflected in the other copies  a further innovation is some file systems do not expand  or shrink on these systems the original size is the only size and any change  requires copying data an administrator can configure inserv to provide a  host with a large amount of logical storage that initially occupies only a small  amount of physical storage as the host starts using the storage unused disks  are allocated to the host up to the original logical level the host thus can  believe that it has a large fixed storage space create its file systems there and  so on disks can be added or removed from the file system by inserv without  the file systems noticing the change this feature can reduce the number of  drives needed by hosts or at least delay the purchase of disks until they are  really needed  high space overhead raid levels is often preferred for storing large volumes  of data level is not supported currently by many raid implementations but  it should offer better reliability than levels  raid system designers and administrators of storage have to make several  other decisions as well for example how many disks should be in a given  raid set how many bits should be protected by each parity bit if more disks  are in an array data transfer rates are higher but the system is more expensive  if more bits are protected by a parity bit the space overhead due to parity bits  is lower but the chance that a second disk will fail before the first failed disk is  repaired is greater and that will result in data loss   extensions  the concepts of raid have been generalized to other storage devices including  arrays of tapes and even to the broadcast of data over wireless systems when  applied to arrays of tapes raid structures are able to recover data even if one  of the tapes in an array is damaged when applied to broadcast of data a  block of data is split into short units and is broadcast along with a parity unit  if one of the units is not received for any reason it can be reconstructed from the  other units comrnonly tape drive robots containing multiple tape drives will  stripe data across all the drives to increase throughput and decrease backup  time     problems with raid  unfortunately raid does not always assure that data are available for the  operating system and its users a pointer to a file could be wrong for example  or pointers within the file structure could be wrong incomplete writes if not  properly recovered could result in corrupt data some other process could  accidentally write over a file system s structures too raid protects against  physical media errors but not other hardware and software errors as large as  is the landscape of software and hardware bugs that is how numerous are the  potential perils for data on a system  the solaris zfs file system takes an innovative approach to solving these  problems through the use of a technique which is used to verify  the integrity of data zfs maintains internal checksums of all blocks including  data and metadata these checksums are not kept with the block that is being  checksummed ratheh they are stored with the pointer to that block see  figure  consider an inode with pointers to its data within the inode is  the checksum of each block of data if there is a problem with the data the  checksum will be incorrect and the file system will know about it if the data  are mirrored and there is a block with a correct checksum and one with an  incorrect checksum zfs will automatically update the bad block with the good  one similarly the directory entry that points to the inode has a checksum for the  inode any problem in the inode is detected when the directory is accessed  this checksumming takes places throughout all zfs structures providing a  much higher level of consistency error detection and error correction than is  found in raid disk sets or standard file systems the extra overhead that is  created by the checksum calculation and extra block read modify write cycles  is not noticeable because the overall performance of zfs is very fast  another issue with most raid implementations is lack of flexibility  consider a storage array with twenty disks divided into four sets of five disks  each set of five disks is a raid level set as a result there are four separate  data  figure zfs checksums all metadata and data   chapter  volumes each holding a file system but what if one file system is too large  to fit on a five disk raid level set and what if another file system needs  very little space if such factors are known ahead of time then the disks and  volumes can be properly allocated very frequently however disk use and  requirements change over time  even if the storage array allowed the entire set of twenty disks to be  created as one large raid set other issues could arise several volumes of  various sizes could be built on the set but some volume managers do not  allow us to change a volume s size in that case we would be left with the same  issue described above mismatched file system sizes some volume n lanagers  allow size changes but some file systems do not allow for file system growth  or shrinkage the volumes could change sizes but the file systems would need  to be recreated to take advantage of those changes  zfs combines file system management and volume management into a  unit providing greater functionality than the traditional separation of those  functions allows disks or partitions of disks are gathered together via raid  sets into of storage a pool can hold one or more zfs file systems the  entire pool s free space is available to all file systems within that pool zfs uses  the memory model of malloc and free to allocate and release storage for  each file system as blocks are used and freed within the file system as a result  there are no artificial limits on storage use and no need to relocate file systems  between volumes or resize volumes zfs provides quotas to limit the size of a  file system and reservations to assure that a file system can grow by a specified  amount but those variables may be changed by the file system owner at any  time figure a depicts traditional volumes and file systems and figure   b shows the zfs model  i fs i     a traditional volumes and file systems   b zfs and pooled storage  figure a traditional volumes and file systems b a zfs pool and file systems     in chapter we introduced the write ahead log which requires the availability  of stable storage by definition information residing in stable storage is never  lost to implement such storage we need to replicate the required information  on multiple storage devices usually disks with independent failure modes  we also need to coordinate the writing of updates in a way that guarantees  that a failure during an update will not leave all the copies in a damaged state  and that when we are recovering from a failure we can force all copies to a  consistent and correct value even if another failure occurs during the recovery  in this section we discuss how to meet these needs  a disk write results in one of three outcomes  successful completion the data were written correctly on disk  partial failure a failure occurred in the midst of transfer so only some of  the sectors were written with the new data and the sector being written  during the failure may have been corrupted  total failure the failure occurred before the disk write started so the  previous data values on the disk remain intact  whenever a failure occurs during writing of a block the system needs to  detect it and invoke a recovery procedure to restore the block to a consistent  state to do that the system must maintain two physical blocks for each logical  block an output operation is executed as follows  write the information onto the first physical block  when the first write completes successfully write the same injormation  onto the second physical block  declare the operation complete only after the second write completes  successfully  during recovery from a failure each pair of physical blocks is examined  if both are the same and no detectable error exists then no further action is  necessary if one block contains a detectable error then we replace its contents  with the value of the other block if neither block contains a detectable error  but the blocks differ in content then we replace the content of the first block  with that of the second this recovery procedure ensures that a write to stable  storage either succeeds completely or results in no change  we can extend this procedure easily to allow the use of an arbitrarily large  number of copies of each block of stable storage although having a large  number of copies further reduces the probability of a failure it is usually  reasonable to simulate stable storage with only two copies the data in stable  storage are guaranteed to be safe unless a failure destroys all the copies  because waiting for disk writes to complete synchronous i o is time  consuming many storage arrays add nvram as a cache since the memory is  nonvolatile it usually has battery power to back up the unit s power it can  be trusted to store the data en route to the disks it is thus considered part of   chapter   the stable storage writes to it are much faster than to disk so performance is  greatly improved  would you buy a dvd or cd player that had one disk sealed inside of course  not you expect to use a dvd or cd player with many relatively inexpensive  disks on a computer as well using many inexpensive cartridges with one  drive lowers the overall cost low cost is the defining characteristic of tertiary  storage which we discuss in this section   tertiary storage devices  because cost is so important in practice tertiary storage is built with  the most common examples are floppy disks tapes and read only  write once and rewritable cds and dvds many any other kinds of tertiary\\xad storage devices are available as well including removable devices that store  data in flash memory and interact with the computer system via a usb interface   removable disks  removable disks are one kind of tertiary storage floppy disks are an example  of removable magnetic disks they are made from a thin flexible disk coated  with magnetic material and enclosed in a protective plastic case although  common floppy disks can hold only about mb similar technology is used  for removable magnetic disks that hold more than gb removable magnetic  disks can be nearly as fast as hard disks although the recording stuface is at  greater risk of from scratches  a is another kind of removable disk it records data  on a rigid platter coated with magnetic material but the recording technology  is quite different from that for a magnetic disk the magneto optic head flies  much farther from the disk surface than a magnetic disk head does and the  magnetic material is covered with a thick protective layer of plastic or glass  this arrangement makes the disk much more resistant to head crashes  the magneto optic disk drive has a coil that produces a magnetic field at  room temperature the field is too large and too weak to magnetize a bit on the  disk to write a bit the disk head flashes a laser beam at the disk surface the  laser is aimed at a tiny spot where a bit is to be written the laser heats this  spot which makes the spot susceptible to the magnetic field now the large  weak magnetic field can record a tiny bit  the magneto optic head is too far from the disk surface to read the data by  detecting the tiny magnetic fields in the way that the head of a hard disk does  instead the drive reads a bit using a property of laser light called the  when a laser beam is bounced off of a magnetic spot the polarization  of the laser beam is rotated clockwise or counterclockwise dependin g on the  orientation of the magnetic field this rotation is what the head detects to read  a bit  another category of removable disk is the optical disks do not  use magnetism at all instead they use special materials that can be altered by  laser light to have relatively dark or bright spots one exarnple of optical disk    technology is the which is coated with a material that can  freeze into either a crystalline or an amorphous state the crystalline state is  more transparent and hence a laser beam is brighter when it passes through  the ltlaterial and bounces off the reflective layer the phase change drive uses  laser light at three different powers low power to read data medium power  to erase the disk by melting and refreezing the recording medium into the  crystalline state and high power to melt the medium into the amorphous state  to write to the disk the most common examples of this technology are the  re recordable cd rw and dvd rw  the kinds of disks just described can be used over and over they are called  in contrast can  be written only once an old way to make a worm disk is to manufacture a thin  aluminum film sandwiched between two glass or plastic platters to write a  bit the drive uses a laser light to burn a small hole through the aluminum this  burning cannot be reversed although it is possible to destroy the information  on a worm disk by burning holes everywhere it is virtually impossible to alter  data on the disk because holes can only be added and the ecc code associated  with each sector is likely to detect such additions worm disks are considered  durable and reliable because the metal layer is safely encapsulated between  the protective glass or plastic platters and magnetic fields cannot damage the  recording a newer write once technology records on an organic polymer dye  instead of an aluminum layer the dye absorbs laser light to form marks this  technology is used in the recordable cd r and dvd r  read oniv such as cd rom and dvd rom come from the factory  with the data prerecorded they use technology similar to that of worm disks   although the bits are pressed not burned and they are very durable  most removable disks are slower than their nonremovable counterparts  the writing process is slower as are rotation and sometimes seek time   tapes  magnetic tape is another type of removable medium as a general rule a tape  holds more data than an optical or magnetic disk cartridge tape drives and  disk drives have similar transfer rates but random access to tape is much  slower than a disk seek because it requires a fast forward or rewind operation  that takes tens of seconds or even minutes  although a typical tape drive is more expensive than a typical disk drive  the price of a tape cartridge is lower than the price of the equivalent capacity  of magnetic disks so tape is an economical medium for purposes that do not  require fast random access tapes are commonly used to hold backup copies  of disk data they are also used in large supercomputer centers to hold the  enornwus volumes of data used in scientific research and by large commercial  enterprises  large tape installations typically use robotic tape changers that move tapes  between tape drives and storage slots in a tape library these mechanisms give  the computer automated access to many tape cartridges  a robotic tape library can lower the overall cost of data storage a disk\\xad resident file that will not be needed for a while can be to tape where  the cost per gigabyte is lower if the file is needed in the future the computer  can it back into disk storage for active use a robotic tape library is   chapter  sometimes called storage since it is between the high performance  of on line magnetic disks and the low cost of off line tapes sitting on shelves  in a storage room   future technology  in the future other storage technologies may become important sometimes old  technologies are used in new ways as economics change or the technologies  evolve for example solid state disks or are growing in importance and  becoming more common simply described an ssd is a disk that is used like  a hard drive depending on the memory technology used it can be volatile  or nonvolatile the memory technology also affects performance nonvolatile  ssds have the same characteristics as traditional hard disks but can be more  reliable because they have no moving parts and faster because they have no  seek time or latency in addition they use less energy however they are more  expensive per megabyte than traditional hard disks have lower capacity than  the larger hard disks and may have shorter life spans than hard disks so their  uses are limited in one example ssds are being used in storage arrays to hold  metadata which requires high performance such as the journal of a journaling  file system ssds are also being added to notebook computers to make them  smaller faster and more energy efficient  another promising storage technology bologt phk uses laser  light to record holographic photographs on special media we can think of a  hologram as a three dimensional array of pixels each pixel represents one bit   for black or for white and all the pixels in a hologram are transferred in one  flash of laser light so the data transfer rate is extremely high with continued  development holographic storage may become commercially viable  another technology under active research is based on   iv e s the idea is to apply the fabrication  technologies that produce electronic chips to the manufacture of small data\\xad storage machines one proposal calls for the fabrication of an array of  tiny disk heads with a square centimeter of magnetic storage material sus\\xad pended above the array when the storage material is moved lengthwise over  the heads each head accesses its own linear track of data on the material the  storage material can be shifted sideways slightly to enable all the heads to  access their next track although it remains to be seen whether this technology  can be successful it may provide a nonvolatile data storage technology that is  faster than magnetic disk and cheaper than semiconductor dram  whether the storage medium is a removable magnetic disk a dvd or a  magnetic tape the operating system needs to provide several capabilities to use  removable media for data storage these capabilities are discussed in section     operating system support  two major jobs of an operating system are to manage physical devices and  to present a virtual machine abstraction to applications in this chapter we  have seen that for hard disks the operating system provides two abstractions  one is the raw device which is just an array of data blocks the other is a file  system for a file system on a magnetic disk the operating system queues and    schedules the interleaved requests from several applications now we shall see  how the operating system does its job when the storage media are removable   application interface  most operating systems can handle removable disks almost exactly as they do  fixed disks when a blank cartridge is inserted into the drive or mounted the  cartridge must be formatted and then an empty file system is generated on the  disk this file system is used just like a file system on a hard disk  tapes are often handled differently the operating system usually presents  a tape as a raw storage medium an application does not open a file on the  tape it opens the whole tape drive as a raw device usually the tape drive  is then reserved for the exclusive use of that application until the application  exits or closes the tape device this exclusivity makes sense because random  access on a tape can take tens of seconds or even a few minutes so interleaving  random accesses to tapes from more than one application would be likely to  cause thrashing  when the tape drive is presented as a raw device the operating system  does not provide file system services the application must decide how to use  the array of blocks for instance a program that backs up a hard disk to tape  might store a list of file names and sizes at the beginning of the tape and then  copy the data of the files to the tape in that order  it is easy to see the problems that can arise from this way of using tape  since every application makes up its own rules for how to organize a tape  a tape full of data can generally be used only by the program that created it  for instance even if we know that a backup tape contains a list of file names  and file sizes followed by the file data we will still find it difficult to use the  tape how exactly are the file names stored are the file sizes in binary or ascii  form are the files written one per block or are they all concatenated in one  tremendously long string of bytes we do not even know the block size on the  tape because this variable is generally one that can be chosen separately for  each block written  for a disk drive the basic operations are read write and seek  tape drives have a different set of basic operations instead of seek a tape  drive uses the locate operation the tape locate operation is more  precise than the disk seek operation because it positions the tape to a  specific logical block rather than an entire track locating to block is the  same as rewinding the tape  for most kinds of tape drives it is possible to locate to any block that has  been written on a tape in a partly filled tape however it is not possible to  locate into the empty space beyond the written area because most tape drives  do not manage their physical space in the same way disk drives do for a disk  drive the sectors have a fixed size and the formatting process must be used to  place empty sectors in their final positions before any data can be written most  tape drives have a variable block size and the size of each block is detern ined  on the fly when that block is written if an area of defective tape is encountered  during writing the bad area is skipped and the block is written again this  operation explains why it is not possible to locate into the empty space beyond  the written area the positions and numbers of the logical blocks have not yet  been detennined   chapter  most tape drives have a read position operation that returns the  logical block number where the tape head is currently located many tape  drives also support a space operation for relative motion so for example  the operation space  would locate backward over two logical blocks  for most kinds of tape drives writing a block has the side effect of logically  erasing everything beyond the position of the write in practice this side effect  means that most tape drives are append only devices because updating a  block in the middle of the tape also effectively erases everything beyond that  block the tape drive implements this appending by placing an end of tape   eot mark after a block that is written the drive refuses to locate past the eot  mark but it is possible to locate to the eot and then start writing doing so  overwrites the old eot mark and places a new one at the end of the new blocks  just written  in principle a file system can be implemented on a tape but many of the  file system data structures and algorithms would be different from those used  for disks because of the append only property of tape   file naming  another question that the operating system needs to handle is how to name  files on removable media for a fixed disk naming is not difficult on a pc the  file name consists of a drive letter followed by a path name in unix the file  name does not contain a drive letter but the molmt table enables the operating  system to discover on what drive the file is located if the disk is removable  however knowing what drive contained the cartridge at some time in the past  does not mean knowing how to find the file if every removable cartridge in  the world had a different serial number the name of a file on a removable  device could be prefixed with the serial number but to ensure that no two  serial numbers are the same would require each one to be about digits in  length who could remember the names of her files if she had to memorize a   digit serial number for each one  the problem becomes even more difficult when we want to write data  on a removable cartridge on one computer and then use the cartridge in  another computer if both machines are of the same type and have the same  kind of removable drive the only difficulty is knowing the contents and data  layout on the cartridge but if the machines or drives are different many  additional problems can arise even if the drives are compatible different  computers may store bytes in different orders and may use different encodings  for binary numbers and even for letters such as ascii on pcs versus ebcdic  on mainframes  today s operating systems generally leave the name space problem  unsolved for removable media and depend on applications and users to figure  out how to access and interpret the data fortunately a few kinds of removable  media are so well standardized that all computers use them the same way one  example is the cd music cds use a universal format that is understood by any  cd drive data cds are available in only a few different formats so it is usual  for a cd drive and the operating system device driver to be programmed to  handle all the comnon formats dvd fonnats are also well standardized     hierarchical storage management  a ju enables the computer to change the removable cartridge in a  tape or disk drive without human assistance two major uses of this technology  are for backups and hierarchical storage systems the use of a jukebox for  backups is simple when one cartridge becomes full the computer instructs  the jukebox to switch to the next cartridge some jukeboxes hold tens of drives  and thousands of cartridges with robotic arms managing the movement of  tapes to the drives  a hierarchical storage system extends the storage hierarchy beyond  primary memory and secondary storage that is magnetic disk to incorporate  tertiary storage tertiary storage is usually implemented as a jukebox of tapes  or removable disks this level of the storage hierarchy is larger cheaper and  slower  although the virtual memory system can be extended in a straightforward  manner to tertiary storage this extension is rarely carried out in practice the  reason is that a retrieval from a jukebox can take tens of seconds or even  minutes and such a long delay is intolerable for demand paging and for other  forms of virtual memory use  the usual way to incorporate tertiary storage is to extend the file system  small and frequently used files remain on magnetic disk while large and old  files that are not actively used are archived to the jukebox in some file archiving  systems the directory entry for the file continues to exist but the contents of  the file no longer occupy space in secondary storage if an application tries to  open the file the open system call is suspended until the file contents can  be staged in from tertiary storage when the contents are again available from  magnetic disk the open operation returns control to the application which  proceeds to use the disk resident copy of the data  today is usually found in instal  lations that have large volumes of data that are used seldom sporadically  current work in hsm includes extending it to provide full  here data move from disk to tape  and back to disk as needed but are deleted on a schedule or according to  policy for example some sites save e mail for seven years but want to be sure  that at the end of seven years it is destroyed at that point the data might be  on disk hsm tape and backup tape ilm centralizes knowledge of where the  data are so that policies can be applied across all these locations   performance issues  as with any component of the operating system the three most important  aspects of tertiary storage performance are speed reliability and cost   speed  the speed of tertiary storage has two aspects bandwidth and latency we  measure the bandwidth in bytes per second the is  the average data rate during a transfer that is the number of bytes  divided by the transfer time the calculates the average  over the entire l time including the time for seek or locate and any   chapter  cartridge switching time in a jukebox in essence the sustained bandwidth is  the rate at which the data stream actually flows and the effective bandwidth is  the overall data rate provided by the drive the bandwidth of a drive is generally  understood to mean the sustained bandwidth  for removable disks tlce bandwidth ranges from a few megabytes per  second for the slowest to over mb per second for the fastest tapes have a  similar range of bandwidths from a few megabytes per second to over mb  per second  the second aspect of speed is the by this performance  measure disks are much faster than tapes disk storage is essentially two\\xad dimensional all the bits are out in the open a disk access simply moves the  ann to the selected cylinder and waits for the rotational latency which may  take less than milliseconds by contrast tape storage is three dimensional  at any time a small portion of the tape is accessible to the head whereas most  of the bits are buried below hundreds or thousands of layers of tape wound  on the reel a random access on tape requires winding the tape reels until  the selected block reaches the tape head which can take tens or hundreds of  seconds so we can generally say that random access within a tape cartridge is  more than a thousand times slower than random access on disk  if a jukebox is involved the access latency can be significantly higher for  a removable disk to be changed the drive must stop spinning then the robotic  arm must switch the disk cartridges and then the drive must spin up the new  cartridge this operation takes several seconds about a hundred times longer  than the random access time within one disk so switching disks in a jukebox  incurs a relatively high performance penalty  for tapes the robotic ann time is about the same as for disks but for tapes  to be switched the old tape generally must rewind before it can be ejected and  that operation can take as long as minutes and after a new tape is loaded  into the drive many seconds can be required for the drive to calibrate itself  to the tape and to prepare for i although a slow tape jukebox can have a  tape switch time of or minutes this time is not enormously greater than the  random access time within one tape  to generalize we can say that random access in a disk jukebox has a  latency of tens of seconds whereas random access in a tape jukebox has a  latency of hundreds of seconds switching tapes is expensive but switching  disks is not we must be careful not to overgeneralize though some expensive  tape jukeboxes can rewind eject load a new tape and fast forward to a random  item of data all in less than seconds  if we pay attention to only the performance of the drives in a jukebox  the bandwidth and latency seem reasonable but if we focus our attention  on the cartridges instead we find a terrible bottleneck consider first the  bandwidth the bandwidth to storage capacity ratio of a robotic library is  much less favorable than that of a fixed disk to read all the data stored on  a large hard disk could take about an hour to read all the data stored in a  large tape library could take years the situation with respect to access latency  is nearly as bad to illustrate if requests are queued for a disk drive  the average waiting time will be about a second if requests are queued  for a tape library the average waiting time could be over an hour the low  cost of tertiary storage results from having many cheap cartridges share a few  expensive drives but a removable library is best devoted to the storage of    infrequently used data because the library can satisfy only a relatively small  number of i requests per hour   reliability  although we often think good pejormance means high speed another important  aspect of performance is reliability if we try to read some data and are unable  to do so because of a drive or media failure for all practical purposes the access  time is infinitely long and the bandwidth is infinitely small so it is important  to understand the reliability of removable media  removable n ag netic disks are somewhat less reliable than are fixed hard  disks because they are more likely to be exposed to harmful environmental  conditions such as dust large changes in temperature and humidity and  mechanical forces such as shock and bending optical disks are considered  very reliable because the layer that stores the bits is protected by a transparent  plastic or glass layer the reliability of magnetic tape varies widely depending  on the kind of drive some inexpensive drives wear out tapes after a few dozen  uses other drives are gentle enough to allow millions of reuses by comparison  with a magnetic disk head the head in a magnetic tape drive is a weak spot  a disk head flies above the media but a tape head is in close contact with  the tape the scrubbing action of the tape can wear out the head after a few  thousands or tens of thousands of hours  in summary we can say that a fixed disk drive is likely to be more reliable  than a removable disk or tape drive and an optical disk is likely to be more  reliable than a magnetic disk or tape but a fixed magnetic disk has one  weakness a head crash in a hard disk generally destroys the data whereas  the failure of a tape drive or optical disk drive often leaves the data cartridge  unharmed   cost  storage cost is another important factor here is a concrete example of how  removable media may lower the overall storage cost suppose that a hard disk  that holds x gb has a price of of this amom t is for the housing  motor and controller and is for the magnetic platters the storage cost  for this disk is x per gigabyte now suppose that we can manufacture  the platters in a removable cartridge for one drive and cartridges the total  price is  and the capacity is lox gb so the storage cost is x per  gigabyte even if it is a little more expensive to make a removable cartridge  the cost per gigabyte of removable storage may well be lower than the cost per  gigabyte of a hard disk because the expense of one drive is averaged with the  low price of many removable cartridges  figures  and show cost trends per megabyte for dram  memory magnetic hard disks and tape drives the prices in the graphs are  the lowest prices found in advertisements in various computer magazines and  on the world wide web at the end of each year these prices reflect the small\\xad computer marketplace of the readership of these magazines where prices are  low by comparison with the mainframe and minicomputer markets in the case  of tape the price is for a drive with one tape the overall cost of tape storage  becomes much lower as more tapes are purchased for use with the drive   chapter  co                     kb    mb mb  gb  ·  c    cc  c  r   c o c   c  c cl c   o  oo c oo   l  c oo  oos  year  figure price per megabyte of dram from to  because the price of a tape is a small fraction of the price of the drive however  in a huge tape library containing thousands of cartridges the storage cost is  dominated by the cost of the tape cartridges as of the cost per gb of tape  cartridges was around   as figure shows the cost of dram fluctuates widely in the period  from to we can see three price crashes around  and   as excess production caused a glut in the marketplace we can also  see two periods around and where shortages in the marketplace  caused sigrtificant price increases in the case of hard disks figure  the  price decline has been steadier tape drive prices also fell steadily up to   figure  since the price per gigabyte of inexpensive tape drives  has ceased its dramatic fall although the price of mid range tape technology   such as dat dds has continued to fall and is now approaching that of the  figure price per megabyte of a tape drive from to  in expensive drives tape drive prices are not shown for years prior to  because as mentioned the magazines used in tracking prices are targeted to  the small computer marketplace and tape drives were not widely used with  small computers prior to  we can see from these graphs that the cost of storage has fallen dramatically  by comparing the graphs we can also see that the price of disk storage has  plummeted relative to the price of dram and tape  the price per megabyte of magnetic disk storage improved by more than  four orders of magnitude from to whereas the corresponding  improvement for main memory was only three orders of magnitude main  memory today is more expensive than disk storage by a factor of  the price per megabyte dropped much more rapidly for disk drives than  for tape drives as well in fact the price per megabyte of a magnetic disk drive  is approaching that of a tape cartridge without the tape drive consequently  small and medium sized tape libraries have a higher storage cost than disk  systems with equivalent capacity  the dramatic fall in disk prices has largely rendered tertiary storage  obsolete we no longer have any tertiary storage technology that is orders  of magnitude less expensive than magnetic disk it appears that the revival  of tertiary storage must await a revolutionary technology breakthrough  meanwhile tape storage will find its use mostly limited to purposes such  as backups of disk drives and archival storage in enormous tape libraries that  greatly exceed the practical storage capacity of large disk farms  disk drives are the major secondary storage i devices on most computers  most secondary storage devices are either magnetic disks or n agnetic tapes  modern disk drives are structured as large one dimensional arrays of logical  disk blocks generally these logical blocks are bytes in size disks may be  attached to a computer system in one of two ways  through the local i  ports on the host computer or through a network cmmection   chapter  requests for disk i are generated by the file system and by the virtual  memory system each request specifies the address on the disk to be referenced  in the form of a logical block number disk schedliling algorithms can improve  the effective bandwidth the average response time and the variance in  response time algorithms such as sstf scan c scan look and c look  are designed to make such improvements through strategies for disk queue  ordering  performance can be harmed by external fragmentation some systems  have utilities that scan the file system to identify fragmented files they then  move blocks around to decrease the fragmentation defragmenting a badly  fragmented file system can significantly improve performance but the systenc  may have reduced performance while the defragmentation is in progress  sophisticated file systems such as the unix fast file system incorporate  many strategies to control fragmentation during space allocation so that disk  reorganization is not needed  the operating system manages the disk blocks first a disk must be low\\xad level formatted to create the sectors on the raw hardware new disks usually  come preformatted then the disk is partitioned file systems are created and  boot blocks are allocated to store the system s bootstrap program finally when  a block is corrupted the system must have a way to lock out that block or to  replace it logically with a spare  because an efficient swap space is a key to good performance systems  usually bypass the file system and use raw disk access for paging i some  systems dedicate a raw disk partition to swap space and others use a file  within the file system instead still other systems allow the user or system  administrator to make the decision by providing both options  because of the amount of storage required on large systems disks are  frequently made redundant via raid algorithms these algorithms allow more  than one disk to be used for a given operation and allow continued operation  and even automatic recovery in the face of a disk failure raid algorithms  are organized into different levels each level provides some combination of  reliability and high transfer rates  the write ahead log scheme requires the availability of stable storage  to implement such storage we need to replicate the needed information on  multiple nonvolatile storage devices usually disks with independent failure  modes we also need to update the information in a controlled manner to  ensure that we can recover the stable data after any failure during data transfer  or recovery  tertiary storage is built from disk and tape drives that use removable  media many different technologies are available including magnetic tape  removable magnetic and magneto optic disks and optical disks  for removable disks the operating system generally provides the full  services of a file system interface including space management and request\\xad queue scheduling for many operating systems the name of a file on a  removable cartridge is a combination of a drive name and a file name within  that drive this convention is simpler but potentially more confusing than is  using a name that identifies a specific cartridge  for tapes the operating system generally provides only a raw interface  many operating systems have no built in support for jukeboxes jukebox    support can be provided by a device driver or by a privileged application  designed for backups or for hsm  three important aspects of performance are bandwidth latency and  reliability many bandwidths are available for both disks and tapes but the  random access latency for a tape is generally much greater than that for a disk  switching cartridges in a jukebox is also relatively slow because a jukebox  has a low ratio of drives to cartridges reading a large fraction of the data in a  jukebox can take a long time optical media which protect the sensitive layer  with a transparent coating are generally more robust than magnetic media  which are more likely to expose the magnetic material to physical damage  lastly the cost of storage has decreased greatly in the past two decades most  notably for disk storage   what would be the effects on cost and performance if tape storage had  the same areal density as disk storage areal density is the number of  gigabits per square inch   it is sometimes said that tape is a sequential access medium whereas  a magnetic disk is a random access medium in fact the suitability  of a storage device for random access depends on the transfer size  the term streaming transfer rate denotes the rate for a data transfer  that is underway excluding the effect of access latency by contrast the  effective transfer rate is the ratio of total bytes per total seconds including  overhead time such as access latency  suppose that in a computer the level cache has an access latency  of nanoseconds and a streaming transfer rate of megabytes per  second the main memory has an access latency of nanoseconds and  a streaming transfer rate of megabytes per second the magnetic disk  has an access latency of milliseconds and a streaming transfer rate  of megabytes per second and a tape drive has an access latency of  seconds and a streaming transfer rate of megabytes per seconds  a random access causes the effective transfer rate of a device to  decrease because no data are transferred during the access time  for the disk described what is the effective transfer rate if an  average access is followed by a streaming transfer of  bytes   kilobytes  megabyte and  megabytes  b the utilization of a device is the ratio of effective transfer rate to  streaming transfer rate calculate the utilization of the disk drive  for each of the four transfer sizes given in part a  c suppose that a utilization of percent or higher is considered  acceptable using the performance figures given compute the  smallest transfer size for disk that gives acceptable utilization   chapter  d complete the following sentence a disk is a random access  device for transfers larger than  bytes and is a sequential  access device for snaller transfers  e compute the minimum transfer sizes that give acceptable utiliza\\xad tion for cache memory and tape  f when is a tape a random access device and when is it a  sequential access device   the reliability of a hard disk drive is typically described in terms of a  quantity called mean time between failures mtbf although this quantity  is called a time the mtbf actually is measured in drive hours per  failure  a if a system contains disk drives each of which has a  hour mtbf which of the following best describes how often a  drive failure will occur in that disk farm once per thousand  years once per century once per decade once per year once per  month once per week once per day once per hour once per  minute or once per second  b mortality

this mtbf tell you about the expected  lifetime of a year old  c the manufacturer guarantees a million hour mtbf for a certain  model of disk drive what can you conclude about the number of  years for which one of these drives is under warranty   discuss how an operating system could maintain a free space list  for a tape resident file system assume that the tape technology is  append only and that

consider a raid level organization comprising five disks with the  parity for sets of four blocks on four disks stored on the fifth disk how  many blocks are accessed in order to perform the following  a a write of one block of data  b a write of seven continuous blocks of data   the operating system generally treats removable disks as shared file  systems but assigns a tape drive to only one application at a time give  three reasons that could explain this difference in treatment of disks and  tapes describe the additional features that an operating system would  need to support shared file system access to a tape jukebox would the  applications sharing the tape jukebox need any special properties or  could they use the files as though the files were disk resident explain  your answer   how would use of a ram disk affect your selection of a disk scheduling  algorithm what factors would you need to consider do the same  considerations apply to hard disk scheduling given that the file system  stores recently used blocks in a buffer cache in main memory   you can use simple estimates to compare the cost and performance  of a terabyte storage system made entirely from disks

system if you make    any assumptions about the workload describe and justify them now  suppose that percent of the data are frequently used so they must  reside on disk but the other percent are archived in the tape library  further suppose that the disk system handles percent of the requests  and the library handles the other percent what are the total cost  the maximum total data rate and the average waiting time for this  hierarchical storage system   assume that you have a mixed configuration comprising disks orga\\xad nized as raid levell and raid levels disks assume that the system  has flexibility in deciding which disk organization to use for storing a  particular file which files should be stored in the raid level disks  and which in the raid levels disks in order to optimize performance   what are the tradeoffs involved in rereading code pages from the file  system versus using swap space to store them   requests are not usually uniformly distributed for example we can  expect a cylinder containing the file system fat or inodes to be accessed  more frequently than a cylinder containing only files suppose you  know that percent of the requests are for a small fixed number of  cylinders  a would any of the scheduling algorithms discussed in this chapter  be particularly good for this case explain your answer  b propose a disk scheduling algorithm that gives even better per\\xad formance by taking advantage of this hot spot on the disk  c file systems typically fil d data blocks via an indirection table  such as a fat in dos or inodes in unix describe one or

disk technology and several potential future storage technologies    r  the two main jobs of a computer are i and processing in many cases the  main job is i and the processing is merely incidental for instance when  we browse a web page or edit a file our immediate interest is to read or enter  some information not to compute an answer  the role of the operating system in computer i is to manage and  control i operations and i devices although related topics appear in  other chapters here we bring together the pieces to paint a complete picture  of i first we describe the basics of i o hardware because the nature of the  hardware interface places constraints on the internal facilities of the operating  system next we discuss the i services provided by the operating system  and the embodiment of these services in the application i interface then  we explain how the operating system bridges the gap between the hardware  interface and the application interface we also discuss the unix system v  streams mechanism which enables an application to assemble pipelines of  driver code dynamically finally we discuss the performance aspects of i o  and the principles of operating system design that improve i performance  to explore the structure of an operating system s subsystem  to discuss the principles and complexities of hardware  to explain the performance aspects of hardware and software  the control of devices connected to the computer is a major concern of  operating system designers because i o devices vary so widely in their  function and speed consider a mouse a hard disk and a cd rom jukebox  varied methods are needed to control them these methods form the i  subsystem of the kernet which separates the rest of the kernel from the  complexities of managing i devices     chapter   i o device technology exhibits two conflicting trends on the one hand we  see increasing standardization of software and hardware interfaces this trend  helps s to incorporate improved device generations into existing computers  and operating systems on the other hand we see an increasingly broad variety  of devices some new devices are so unlike previous devices that it is a  challenge to incorporate them into our computers and operating systems this  challenge is met by a combination of hardware and software techniques the  basic i hardware elements such as ports buses and device controllers  accommodate a wide variety of i devices to encapsulate the details and  oddities of different devices the kernel of an operating system is structured  to use device driver modules the present a uniform device\\xad access interface to the i subsystem much as system calls provide a standard  interface between the application and the operating system  computers operate a great many kinds of devices most fit into the general  categories of storage devices disks tapes transmission devices network  cards modems and human interface devices screen keyboard mouse  other devices are more specialized sch as those involved in the steering  of a military fighter jet or a space shuttle in these aircraft a human gives input  to the flight computer via a joystick and foot pedals and the computer sends  output commands that cause motors to move rudders flaps and thrusters  despite the incredible variety of i devices though we need only a few  concepts to understand how the devices are attached and how the software  can control the hardware  a device communicates with a computer system by sending signals over a  cable or even through the air the device communicates with the machine via a  connection point or example a serial port if devices use a common  set of wires the connection is called a bus a is a set of wires and a rigidly  defined protocol that specifies a set of messages that can be sent on the wires  in terms of the electronics the messages are conveyed by patterns of electrical  voltages applied to the wires with defined timings when device a has a cable  that plugs into device b and device b has a cable that plugs into device c and  device c plugs into a port on the computer this arrangement is called a  a daisy chain usually operates as a bus  buses are used widely in computer architecture and vary in their signaling  methods speed throughput and connection methods a typical pc bus  structure appears in figure this figure shows a the common  pc system bus that connects the processor memory subsystem to the fast  devices and an that connects relatively slow devices such as  the keyboard and serial and usb ports in the upper right portion of the figure  four disks are cmected together on a scsi bus plugged into a scsi controller  other common buses used to interconnect main parts of a computer include  with up to gb pcie with throughput up  with throughput up to gb  is a collection of electronics that can operate a port a bus  or a device a serial port controller is a simple device controller it is a single  chip or portion of a chip in the computer that controls the signals on the    figure a typical pc bus structure  wires of a serial port by contrast a scsi bus controller is not simple because  the scsi protocol is complex the scsi bus controller is often implemented as  a separate circuit board or a that plugs into the computer it  typically contains a processor microcode and some private memory to enable  it to process the scsi protocol messages some devices have their own built in  controllers if you look at a disk drive you will see a circuit board attached  to one side this board is the disk controller it implements the disk side of  the protocol for some kind of comection scsi or ata for instance it has  microcode and a processor to do many tasks such as bad sector mapping  prefetching buffering and caching  how can the processor give commands and data to a controller to  accomplish an i transfer the short answer is that the controller has one  or more registers for data and control signals the processor communicates  with the controller by reading and writing bit patterns in these registers one  way in which this communication can occur is through the use of special  i instructions that specify the transfer of a byte or word to an i port  address the i instruction triggers bus lines to select the proper device and  to move bits into or out of a device register alternatively the device controller  can support in this case the device control registers  are mapped into the address space of the processor the cpu executes i  requests using the standard data transfer instructions to read and write the  device control registers  some systems use both techniques for instance pcs use i instructions  to control some devices and memory mapped i to control others figure   shows the usual i o port addresses for pcs the graphics controller has  i o ports for basic control operations but the controller has a large memory   chapter   f dma controller   interrupt controller   timer   f game controller  f ff serial port secondary   f hard disk controller   f parallel port  d df graphics controller  f f diskette drive controller  f ff serial port primary  figure device port locations on pcs partial  mapped region to hold screen contents the process sends output to the screen  by writing data into the memory mapped region the controller generates  the screen image based on the contents of this memory this technique is  simple to use moreover writing millions of bytes to the graphics memory  is faster than issuing millions of i instructions but the ease of writing  to a memory mapped i controller is offset by a disadvantage because a  common type of software fault is a write through an incorrect pointer to an  unintended region of memory a memory mapped device register is vulnerable  to accidental modification of course protected memory helps to reduce this  risk  an i port typically consists of four registers called the status   control  data in and data out registers  the  the is read by the host to get input  is written by the host to send output  the contains bits that can be read by the host these bits  indicate states such as whether the current command has completed  whether a byte is available to be read from the data in register and whether  a device error has occurred  the can be written by the host to start a command or to  change the nlode of a device for instance a certain bit in the control  register of a serial port chooses between full duplex and half duplex  communication another bit enables parity checking a third bit sets the  word length to or bits and other bits select one of the speeds supported  by the serial port  the data registers are typically to bytes in size some controllers have  fifo chips that can hold several bytes of input or output data to expand the  capacity of the controller beyond the size of the data register a fifo chip can  hold a small burst of data until the device or host is able to receive those data     polling  the complete protocol for interaction between the host and a controller  can be intricate but the basic handshaking notion is simple we explain  handshaking with an example assume that bits are used to coordinate  the producer consumer relationship between the controller and the host the  controller indicates its state through the busy bit in the status register recall  that to set a bit means to write a into the bit and to clear a bit means to write  a into it the controller sets the busy bit when it is busy working and clears  the busy bit when it is ready to accept the next comm and the host signals  its wishes via the command ready bit in the command register the host sets the  command ready bit when a command is available for the controller to execute  for this example the host writes output through a port coordinating with the  controller by handshaking as follows  the host repeatedly reads the busy bit until that bit becomes clear  the host sets the write bit in the command register and writes a byte into  the data out register  the host sets the command ready bit  when the controller notices that the command ready bit is set it sets the  busy bit  the controller reads the command register and sees the write command  it reads the data out register to get the byte and does the i o to the device  the controller clears the command ready bit clears the error bit in the status  register to indicate that the device i o succeeded and clears the busy bit  to indicate that it is finished  this loop is repeated for each byte  in step the host is or it is in a loop reading the  status register over and over until the busy bit becomes clear if the controller  and device are fast this method is a reasonable one but if the wait may be  long the host should probably switch to another task how then does the  host know when the controller has become idle for some devices the host  must service the device quickly or data will be lost for instance when data  are streaming in on a serial port or from a keyboard the small buffer on the  controller will overflow and data will be lost if the host waits too long before  returning to read the bytes  in many computer architectures three cpu instruction cycles are sufficient  to poll a device read a device register logical and to extract a status bit and  branch if not zero clearly the basic polling operation is efficient but polling  becomes inefficient when it is attempted repeatedly yet rarely finds a device  to be ready for service while other useful cpu processing remains undone in  such instances it may be more efficient to arrange for the hardware controller to  notify the cpu when the device becomes ready for service rather than to require  the cpu to poll repeatedly for an i completion the hardware mechanism  that enables a device to notify the cpu is called an   chapter   cpu  device driver initiates  cpu executing checks for  interrupts between instructions  cpu resumes  processing of  interrupted task controller    figure interrupt driven cycle   interrupts  the basic interrupt mechanism works as follows the cpu hardware has a wire  called the that the cpu senses after executing every  instruction when the cpu detects that a controller has asserted a signal on  the line the cpu performs a state save and jumps to the  at a fixed address in memory the interrupt handler  determines the cause of the interrupt performs the necessary processing  performs a state restore and executes a return from interrupt instruction  to return the cpu to the execution state prior to the interrupt we say that  the device controller raises an interrupt by asserting a signal on the interrupt  request line the cpu catches the interrupt and dispatches it to the interrupt  handler and the handler clears the interrupt by servicing the device figure   summarizes the interrupt driven i cycle  this basic interrupt mechanism enables the cpu to respond to an asyn\\xad chronous event as when a device controller becomes ready for service in a  modern operating system however we need nlore sophisticated interrupt\\xad handling features  we need the ability to defer interrupt handling during critical processing    we need an efficient way to dispatch to the proper interrupt handler for  a device without first polling all the devices to see which one raised the  interrupt  we need multilevel interrupts so that the operating system can distin\\xad guish between high and low priority interrupts and can respond with  the appropriate degree of urgency  in modern computer hardware these three features are provided by the cpu  and by the  most cpus have two interrupt request lines one is the     which is reserved for events such as unrecoverable memory errors  the second interrupt line is it can be turned off by the cpu before  the execution of critical instruction sequences that must not be interrupted  the maskable interrupt is used by device controllers to request service  the interrupt mechanism accepts an number that selects a  specific interrupt handling routine from a small set in most architectures this  address is an offset in a table called the this vector contains  the memory addresses of specialized interrupt handlers the purpose of a  vectored interrupt mechanism is to reduce the need for a single interrupt  handler to search all possible sources of interrupts to determine which one  needs service in practice however computers have more devices and hence  interrupt handlers than they have address elements in the interrupt vector  a common way to solve this problem is to use the technique of interrupt  chaining in which each element in the interrupt vector points to the head of  a list of interrupt handlers when an il terrupt is raised the handlers on the  corresponding list are called one by one until one is found that can service  the request this structure is a compromise between the overhead of a huge  interrupt table and the inefficiency of dispatching to a single interrupt handler  figure illustrates the design of theinterruptvector for the intel pentium  processor the events from to which are nonmaskable are used to signal  various error conditions the events from to which are maskable are  used for purposes such as device generated interrupts  the interrupt mechanism also implements a system of  this mechanism enables the cpu to defer the handling of low priority  interrupts without maskii g off all interrupts and makes it possible for a  high priority interrupt to preempt the execution of a low priority interrupt  a modern operating system interacts with the interrupt mechanism in  several ways at boot time the operating system probes the hardware buses  to determine what devices are present and installs the corresponding interrupt  handlers into the interrupt vector during i the various device controllers  raise interrupts when they are ready for service these interrupts signify that  output has cornpleted or that input data are available or that a failure has  been detected the interrupt mechanism is also used to handle a wide variety  of such as dividing by zero accessing a protected or nonexistent  memory address or attempting to execute a privileged instruction from user  mode the events that trigger interrupts have a common property they are  occurrences that induce the cpu to execute an urgent self contained routine  an operating system has other good uses for an efficient hardware and  software mechanism that saves a small amount of processor state and then   chapter                                i       breakpoint  into detected overflow  bound range exception  invalid opcode

example many operating systems  use the interrupt mechanism for virtual memory paging a page fault is an  exception that raises an interrupt the interrupt suspends the current process  and jumps to the page fault handler in the kernel this handler saves the state  of the process moves the process to the wait queue performs page cache  management schedules an i operation to fetch the page schedules another  process to resume execution and then returns from the interrupt  another example is found in the implementation of system calls usually  a program uses library calls to issue system calls the library routines check  the arguments given by the application build a data structure to convey the  arguments to the kernel and then execute a special instruction called a  or this instruction has an operand that identifies the desired  kernel service when a process executes the trap instruction the interrupt  hardware saves the state of the user code switches to supervisor mode and  dispatches to the kernel routine that implements the requested service the  trap is given a relatively low interrupt priority compared with those assigned  to device interrupts executilcg a system call on behalf of an application is less  urgent than servicing a device controller before its fifo queue overflows and  loses data  interrupts can also be used to manage the flow of control within the kernel  for example consider the processing required to complete a disk read one  step is to copy data from kernel space to the user buffer this copying is time  consuming but not urgent it should not block other high priority interrupt    handling another step is to start the next pending l for that disk drive this  step has higher priority if the disks are to be used efficiently we need to start  the next i o as soon as the previous one completes consequently a pair of  interrupt handlers implen ents the kernel code that completes a disk read the  high priority handler records the l status clears the device interrupt starts  the next pending i and raises a low priority interrupt to complete the work  later when the cpu is not occupied with high priority work the low priority  interrupt will be dispatched the corresponding handler completes the user\\xad level i by copying data from kernel buffers to the application space and then  calling the scheduler to place the application on the ready queue  a threaded kernel architecture is well suited to implement multiple  interrupt priorities and to enforce the precedence of interrupt handling over  background processing in kernel and application routines we illustrate this  point with the solaris kernel in solaris interrupt handlers are executed  as kernel threads a range of high priorities is reserved for these threads  these priorities give interrupt handlers precedence over application code and  kernel housekeeping and implement the priority relationships among interrupt  handlers the priorities cause the solaris thread scheduler to preempt low\\xad priority interrupt handlers in favor of higher priority ones and the threaded  implementation enables multiprocessor hardware to run several interrupt  handlers concurrently we describe the interrupt architecture of windows xp  and unix in chapter and appendix a respectively  in summa r y interrupts are used throughout modern operating systems to  handle asynchronous events and to trap to supervisor mode routines in the  kernel to enable the most urgent work to be done first modern computers  use a system of interrupt priorities device controllers hardware faults and  system calls all raise interrupts to trigger kernel routines because interrupts  are used so heavily for time sensitive processing efficient interrupt handling  is required for good system performance   direct memory access  for a device that does large transfers such as a disk drive it seems wasteful  to use an expensive general purpose processor to watch status bits and to  feed data into a controller register one byte at a time a process termed  many computers avoid burdening the main cpu with  pio by offloading some of this work to a special purpose processor called a  to initiate a dma transfer the host  writes a dma command block into memory this block contains a pointer to  the source of a transfer a pointer to the destination of the transfer and a count  of the number of bytes to be transferred the cpu writes the address of this  command block to the dma controller then goes on with other work the dma  controller proceeds to operate the memory bus directly placing addresses on  the bus to perform transfers without the help of the main cpu a simple dma  controller is a standard component in pcs and for  the pc usually contain their own high speed dma hardware  handshaking between the dma controller and the device controller is  performed via a pair of wires called dma request and dma acknowledge  the device controller places a signal on the dma request wire when a word  of data is available for transfer this signal causes the dma controller to seize   chapter  the memory bus place the desired address on the memory address wires  and place a signal on the dl iia acknowledge wire when the device controller  receives the dma acknowledge signat it transfers the word of data to memory  and removes the dma request signal  when the entire transfer is finished the dma controller interrupts the cpu  this process is depicted in figure when the dma controller seizes the  memory bus the cpu is momentarily prevented from accessing main memory  although it can still access data items in its primary and secondary caches  although this can slow down the cpu computation offloading  the data transfer work to a dma controller generally improves the total system  performance some computer architectures use physical memory addresses for  dma but others perform mercwry using virtual  addresses that undergo translation to physical addresses dvma can perform  a transfer between two memory mapped devices without the intervention of  the cpu or the use of main memory  on protected mode kernels the operating system generally prevents  processes from issuing device commands directly this discipline protects data  from access control violations and also protects the system from erroneous use  of device controllers that could cause a system crash instead the operating  system exports functions that a sufficiently privileged process can use to  access low level operations on the underlying hardware on kernels without  memory protection processes can access device controllers directly this direct  access can be used to achieve high performance since it can avoid kernel  communication context switches and layers of kernelsoftware unfortunately  it interferes with system security and stability the trend in general purpose  operating systems is to protect memory and devices so that the system can try  to guard against erroneous or malicious applications   dma controller  transfers bytes to  buffer x increasing  memory address  and decreasing c  until c  device driver is told  to

summary  although the hardware aspects of i are complex when considered at the  level of detail of electronics hardware design the concepts that we have  just described are sufficient to enable us to understand many i features  of operating systen s let s review the main concepts  a bus  a controller  an i port and its registers  the handshaking relationship between the host and a device controller  the execution of this handshaking in a polling loop or via interrupts  the offloading of this work to a dma controller for large transfers  we gave a basic example of the handshaking that takes place between a  device controller and the host earlier in this section in reality the wide variety  of available devices poses a problem for operating system implementers each  kind of device has its own set of capabilities control bit definitions and  protocols for interacting with the host and they are all different how can  the operating system be designed so that we can attach new devices to the  computer without rewriting the operating system and when the devices  vary so widely how can the operating system give a convenient uniform i  interface to applications we address those questions next  in this section we discuss structuring techniques and interfaces for the  operating system that enable i devices to be treated in a standard uniform  way we explain for instance how an application can open a file on a disk  without knowing what kind of disk it is and how new disks and other devices  can be added to a cmnputer without disruption of the operating system  like other complex software engineering problems the approach here  involves abstraction encapsulation and software layering specifically we  can abstract away the detailed differences in i devices by identifying a few  general kinds each kind is accessed through a standardized set of  functions an the differences are encapsulated in kernel modules  called device drivers that internally are custom tailored to specific devices  but that export one of the standard interfaces figure illustrates how the  i o related portions of the kernel are structured in software layers  the purpose of the device driver layer is to hide the differences among  device controllers from the i o subsystem of the kernel much as the i  system calls encapsulate the behavior of devices in a few generic classes  that hide hardware differences from applications making the i subsystem  independent of the hardware simplifies the job of the operating system  developer it also benefits the hardware manufacturers they either design  new devices to be compatible with an existing host controller interface such as  scsi or they write device drivers to interface the new hardware to popular   chapter  figure a kernel i o structure  operating systems thus we can attach new peripherals to a computer without  waiting for the operating system vendor to develop support code  unfortmately for device hardware manufacturers each type of operating  system has its own standards for the device driver interface a given device  may ship with multiple device drivers for instance drivers for ms dos  windows windows nt and solaris devices vary on many  dimensions as illustrated in figure  character stream or block a character stream device transfers bytes one  by one whereas a block device transfers a block of bytes as

keyboard  cd rom  figure i characteristics of devices  for the purpose of application access many of these differences are hidden  by the operating system and the devices are grouped into a few conventional  types the resulting styles of device access have been found to be useful  and broadly applicable although the exact system calls may differ across  operating systems the device categories are fairly standard the major access  conventions include block i character stream i memory mapped file  access and network sockets operating systems also provide special system  calls to access a few additional devices such as a time of day clock and a timer  some operating systems provide a set of system calls for graphical display  video and audio devices  most operating systems also have an or that transpar  ently passes arbitrary conunands from an application to a device driver in  unix this system call is ioctl  for i control the ioctl system call  enables an application to access any functionality that can be implernented by  any device driver without the need to invent a new system call the ioctl  system call has three arguments the first is a file descriptor that connects the  application to the driver by referring to a hardware device managed by that  driver the second is an integer that selects one of the commands implemented  in the driver the third is a pointer to an arbitrary data structure in memory  that enables the application and driver to communicate any necessary control  information or data   block and character devices  the captures all the aspects necessary for accessing disk  drives and other block oriented devices the device is expected to understand  commands such as read and write if it is a random access device it is also  expected to have a seek command to specify which block to transfer next   chapter  applications normally access such a device through a file system interface  we can see that read write and seek capture the essen tial behaviors  of block storage devices so that applications are insulated from the low level  differences among those devices  the operating system itself as well as special applications such as database\\xad management systems may prefer to access a block device as a simple linear  array of blocks this mode of access is sometimes called if the  application performs its own buffering then using a file systen would cause  extra unneeded buffering likewise if an application provides its own locking  of file blocks or regions then any operating system locking services would be  redundant at the least and contradictory at the worst to avoid these conflicts  raw device access passes control of the device directly to the application letting  the operating system step out of the way unfortunately no operating system  services are then performed on this device a compromise that is becoming  common is for the operating system to allow a mode of operation on a file that  disables buffering and locking in the unix world this is called  memory mapped file access can be layered on top of block device drivers  rather than offering read and write operations a memory mapped interface  provides access to disk storage via an array of bytes in main memory the  system call that maps a file into memory returns the virtual memory address  that contains a copy of the file the actual data transfers are performed only  when needed to satisfy access to the memory image because the transfers  are handled by the same mechanism as that used for demand paged virtual  memory access memory mapped i o is efficient memory mapping is also  convenient for programmers access to a memory mapped file is as simple  as reading from and writing to memory operating systems that offer virtual  memory commonly use the mapping interface for kernel services for instance  to execute a program the operating system maps the executable into memory  and then transfers control to the entry address of the executable the mapping  interface is also commonly used for kernel access to swap space on disk  a keyboard is an example of a device that is accessed through a  the basic system calls in this interface enable an application  to get or put one character on top of this interface libraries can be  built that offer line at a time access with buffering and editing services for  example when a user types a backspace the preceding character is removed  from the input stream this style of access is convenient for input devices such  as keyboards mice and modems that produce data for input spontaneously   that is at times that cam ot necessarily be predicted by the application this  access style is also good for output devices such as printers and audio boards  which naturally fit the concept of a linear stream of bytes   network devices  because the performance and addressing characteristics of network i differ  significantly from those of disk i most operating systems provide a network  i o interface that is different from the read write seek interface used  for disks one interface available in many operating systerns including unix  and windows nt is the network interface  think of a wall socket for electricity any electrical appliance can be plugged  in by analogy the system calls in the socket interface enable an application    to create a socket to connect a local socket to a remote address which plugs  this application into a socket created by another application to listen for  any remote application to plug into the local socket and to send and receive  packets over the connection to support the implementation of servers the  socket interface also provides a function called select that manages a set  of sockets a call to select returns information about which sockets have a  packet waiting to be received and which sockets have room to accept a packet  to be sent the use of select eliminates the polling and busy waiting that  would otherwise be necessary for network i these functions encapsulate the  essential behaviors of networks greatly facilitating the creation of distributed  applications that can use any underlying network hardware and protocol stack  many other approaches to interprocess communication and network  communication have been implemented for instance windows nt provides  one interface to the network interface card and a second interface to the  network protocols appendix c in unix which has a long history as a  proving ground for network technology we find half duplex pipes full duplex  fifos full duplex streams message queues and sockets information on unix  networking is given in appendix a   clocks and timers  most computers have hardware clocks and timers that provide three basic  functions  give the current time  give the elapsed time  set a timer to trigger operation x at time t  these functions are used heavily by the operating system as well as by time\\xad sensitive applications unfortunately the system calls that implement these  functions are not standardized across operating systems  the hardware to measure elapsed time and to trigger operations is called  a it can be set to wait a certain amount of time  generate an interrupt and it can be set to do this once or to repeat the  process to generate periodic interrupts the scheduler uses this mechanism to  generate an interrupt that will preempt a process at the end of its time slice  the disk i o subsystem uses it to invoke the periodic flushing of dirty cache  buffers to disk and the network subsystem uses it to cancel operations that are  proceeding too slowly because of network congestion or failures the operating  system may also provide an interface for user processes to use timers the  operating system can support more timer requests than the number of timer  hardware chanels by simulating virtual clocks to do so the kernel or the  timer device driver maintains a list of interrupts wanted by its own routines  and by user requests sorted in earliest time first order it sets the timer for the  earliest tince when the timer interrupts the kernel signals the requester and  reloads the timer with the next earliest time  on many computers the interrupt rate generated by the hardware clock is  between and ticks per second this resolution is coarse since a modern  computer can execute hundreds of millions of instructions per second the   chapter  precision of triggers is limited by the coarse resolution of the timer together  with the overhead of maintaining virtual clocks furthermore if the timer  ticks are used to maintain the system time of day clock the system clock  can drift in most computers the hardware clock is constructed from a high\\xad frequency counter in some computers the value of this counter can be read  from a device register in which case the counter can be considered a high\\xad resolution clock although this clock does not generate interrupts it offers  accurate measurements of time intervals   blocking and nonblocking  another aspect of the system call interface relates to the choice between  blocking i and nonblocking i when an application issues a  system call the execution of the application is suspended the application  is moved from the operating system s run queue to a wait queue after the  system call completes the application is moved back to the run queue where  it is eligible to resume execution when it resumes execution it will receive  the values returned by the system call the physical actions performed by  i devices are generally asynchronous they take a varying or unpredictable  amount of time nevertheless most operating systems use blocking system  calls for the application interface because blocking application code is easier  to understand than nonblocking application code  some user level processes need i one example is a user  interface that receives keyboard and mouse input while processing and  displaying data on the screen another example is a video application that  reads frames from a file on disk while simultaneously decompressing and  displaying the output on the display  one way an application writer can overlap execution with i is to write  a multithreaded application some threads can perform blocking system calls  while others continue executing the solaris developers used this technique to  implement a user level library for asynchronous i freeing the application  writer from that task some operating systems provide nonblocking i system  calls a nonblocking call does not halt the execution of the application for an  extended time h stead it returns quickly with a return value that indicates  how many bytes were transferred  an alternative to a nonblocking system call is an asynchronous system  call an asynchronous call returns immediately without waiting for the i to  complete the application continues to execute its code the completion of the  i at some future time is communicated to the application either through the  setting of some variable in the address space of the application or through the  triggering of a signal or software interrupt or a call back routine that is executed  outside the linear control flow of the application the difference between  nonblocking and asynchronous system calls is that a nonblocking read  returns immediately with whatever data are available the full number of  bytes requested fewer or none at all an asynchronous read call requests a  transfer that will be performed in its entirety but will complete at some future  time these two i methods are shown in figure  a good example of nonblocking behavior is the select system call for  network sockets this system call takes an argument that specifies a maximum  waiting time by setting it to an application can poll for network activity     kernel user user  kernel   a b  figure two methods a synchronous and b asynchronous  without blocking but using select introduces extra overhead because  the select call only checks whether i is possible for a data transfer  select must be followed by some kind of read or write command  a variation on this approach fotmd in mach is a blocking multiple read call  it specifies desired reads for several devices in one system call and returns as  soon as any one of them completes  kernels provide many services related to i several services scheduling  buffering caching spooling device reservation and error handlil g are  provided by the kernel s i subsystem and build on the hardware and device\\xad driver infrastructure the i o subsystem is also responsible for protectil g itself  from errant processes and malicious users    scheduling  to schedule a set of i o requests means to determine a good order in which to  execute them the order in which applications issue system calls rarely is the  best choice scheduling can improve overall system performance can share  device access fairly among processes and can reduce the average waiting time  for i to complete here is a simple example to illustrate suppose that a disk  arm is near the begilming of a disk and that three applications issue blocking  read calls to that disk application requests a block near the end of the disk  application requests one near the beginning and application requests one  in the middle of the disk the operating system can reduce the distance that the  disk ann travels by serving the applications in the order  rearrangil g  the order of service in this way is the essence of i scheduling  operating system developers implement scheduling by maintaining a wait  queue of requests for each device when an application issues a blocking i  system call the request is placed on the queue for that device the i scheduler  rearranges the order of the queue to improve the overall system efficiency  and the average response time experienced by applications the operating   chapter  figure device status table  system may also try to be fair so that no one application receives especially  poor service or it may give priority service for delay sensitive requests for  instance requests from the virtual memory subsystem may take priority over  application requests several scheduling algorithms for disk i are detailed  in section  when a kernel supports asynchronous i it must be able to keep track  of many i requests at the same time for this purpose the operating system  might attach the wait queue to a able the kernel manages this  table which contains an entry for each i device as shown in figure  each table entry indicates the device s type address and state not functioning  idle or busy if the device is busy with a request the type of request and other  parameters will be stored in the table entry for that device  one way in which the i subsystem improves the efficiency of the  computer is by scheduling i operations another way is by using storage  space in main memory or on disk via teclul iques called buffering caching and  spooling   buffering  a is a memory area that stores data being transferred between two  devices or between a device and an application buffering is done for three  reasons one reason is to cope with a speed mismatch between the producer and  consumer of a data stream suppose for example that a file is being received  via modem for storage on the hard disk the modem is about a thousand  times slower than the hard disk so a buffer is created in main mernory to  accumulate the bytes received from the modem when an entire buffer of data  has arrived the buffer can be written to disk in a single operation since the  disk write is not instantaneous and the modem still needs a place to store  additional incoming data two buffers are used after the modem fills the first  buffer the disk write is requested the modem then starts to fill the second  buffer while the first buffer is written to disk by the time the modem has filled    the second buffer the disk write from the first one should have completed  so the modem can switch back to the first buffer while the disk writes the  second one this decouples the producer of data from the  consun er thus relaxing timing requirements between them the need for this  decoupling is illustrated in figure which lists the enormous differences  in device speeds for typical computer hardware  a second use of buffering is to provide adaptations for devices that  have different data transfer sizes such disparities are especially common in  computer networking where buffers are used widely for fragmentation and  reassembly of messages at the sending side a large message is fragmented  into small network packets the packets are sent over the network and the  receiving side places them in a reassembly buffer to form an image of the  source data  a third use of buffering is to support copy semantics for application i  an example will clarify the meaning of copy semantics suppose that an  application has a buffer of data that it wishes to write to disk it calls the  write systemcalt providing a pointer to the buffer and an integer specifying  the number of bytes to write after the system call returns what happens if  the application changes the contents of the buffer with the  version of the data written to disk is guaranteed to be version at the  time of the application system calt independent of any subsequent changes  in the application s buffer a simple way in which the operating system can  guarantee copy semantics is for the write system call to copy the application   chapter  data into a kernel buffer before returning control to the application the disk  write is performed from the kernel buffer so that subsequent changes to the  application buffer have no effect copying of data between kernel buffers and  application data space is common in operating systems despite the overhead  that this operation introduces because of the clean semantics the same effect  can be obtained more efficiently by clever use of virtual memory mapping and  copy on write page protection   caching  a is a region of fast memory that holds copies of data access to the cached  copy is more efficient than access to the original for instance the instructions  of the currently running process are stored on disk cached ilc physical memory  and copied again ill the cpu s secondary and primary caches the difference  between a buffer and a cache is that a buffer may hold the only existing copy  of a data item whereas a cache by definition holds a copy on faster storage of  an item that resides elsewhere  caching and buffering are distinct functions but sometinces a region  of memory can be used for both purposes for illstance to preserve copy  semantics and to enable efficient scheduling of disk i the operating system  uses buffers in maill memory to hold disk data these buffers are also used as  a cache to improve the i o efficiency for files that are shared by applications  or that are being written and reread rapidly when the kernel receives a file  i request the kernel first accesses the buffer cache to see whether that region  of the file is already available in main memory if it is a physical disk i o  can be avoided or deferred also disk writes are accumulated ill the buffer  cache for several seconds so that large transfers are gathered to allow efficient  write schedules this strategy of delayilcg writes to improve i o efficiency is  discussed in the context of remote file access ill section   spooling and device reservation  a is a buffer that holds output for a device such as a printer that cannot  accept ilcterleaved data streams although a prillter can serve only one job  at a time several applications may wish to print their output concurrently  without having their output mixed together the operating system solves this  problem by intercepting all output to the printer each application s output  is spooled to a separate disk file when an application finishes printing the  spooling system queues the correspondilcg spool file for output to the printer  the spooling system copies the queued spool files to the printer one at a time in  some operating systems spooling is managed by a system daemon process in  others it is handled by an in kernel thread in either case the operating system  provides a control interface that enables users and system administrators to  display the queue remove unwanted jobs before those jobs print suspend  printing while the printer is serviced and so on  some devices such as tape drives and printers cannot usefully multiplex  the i requests of multiple concurrent applications spooling is one way  operating systems can coordinate concurrent output another way to deal with  concurrent device access is to provide explicit facilities for coordination some  operating systems including vms provide support for exclusive device access  by enabling a process to allocate an idle device and to deallocate that device    when it is no longer needed other operating systems enforce a limit of one  open file handle to such a device many operating systems provide functions  that enable processes to coordinate exclusive access among then lselves for  instance windows nt provides system calls to wait until a device object  becomes available it also has a parameter to the open system call that  declares the types of access to be permitted to other concurrent threads on  these systems it is up to the applications to avoid deadlock   error handling  an operating system that uses protected memory can guard against many  kinds of hardware and application errors so that a complete system failure is  not the usual result of each minor mechanical glitch devices and i transfers  can fail in many ways either for transient reasons as when a network becomes  overloaded or for permanent reasons as when a disk controller becomes  defective operating systems can often compensate effectively for transient  failures for instance a disk read failure results in a read retry and  a network send error results in a res end if the protocol so specifies  unfortunately if an important component experiences a permanent failure  the operating system is unlikely to recover  as a general rule an i system call will return one bit of information  about the status of the call signifying either success or failure in the unix  operating system an additional integer variable named errno is used to  return an error code one of about a hundred values indicating the general  nature of the failure for example argument out of range bad pointer or  file not open by contrast some hardware can provide highly detailed error  information although many current operating systems are not designed to  convey this information to the application for instance a failure of a scsi  device is reported by the scsi protocol in three levels of detail a key that  identifies the general nature of the failure such as a hardware error or an illegal  request an that states the category of failure such as a  bad command parameter or a self test failure and an  l that gives even more detail such as which command parameter was  in error or which hardware subsystem failed its self test further many scsi  devices maintain internal pages of error log information that can be requested  by the host but seldom are protection  errors are closely related to the issue of protection a user process may  accidentally or purposely attempt to disrupt the normal operation of a systern  by attempting to issue illegal i instructions we can use various mechanisms  to ensure that such disruptions cam lot take place in the system  to prevent users from performing illegal i we define all i instructions  to be privileged instructions thus users cannot issue i o instructions directly  they must do it through the operating system to do i a user program  executes a system call to request that the operating system perform i on its  behalf figure  the operating system executing in monitor mode checks  that the request is valid and if it is does the i requested the operating  system then returns to the user   chapter  cd  trap to  monitor kernel  ®  perform  ®  return  to user  user  program  figure use of a system call to perform  in addition any memory mapped and i o port memory locations must  be protected from user access by the memory protection system note that a  kernel cannot simply deny all user access most graphics games and video  editing and playback software need direct access to memory mapped graphics  controller memory to speed the performance of the graphics for example the  kernel might in this case provide a locking mechanism to allow a section of  graphics memory representing a window on screen to be allocated to one  process at a time   kernel data structures  the kernel needs to keep state information about the use of i components  it does so through a variety of in kernel data structures such as the open file  table structure from section the kernel uses many similar structures to  track network connections character device communications and other i  activities  unix provides file system access to a variety of entities such as user files  raw devices and the address spaces of processes although each of these  entities supports a read operation the semantics differ for instance to  read a user file the kernel needs to probe the buffer cache before deciding  whether to perform a disk i to read a raw disk the kernel needs to ensure  that the request size is a multiple of the disk sector size and is aligned on  a sector boundary to read a process image it is merely necessary to copy  data from memory unix encapsulates these differences within a uniform  structure by using an object oriented teclucique the open file record shown in    system wide open file table  kernel memory  figure unix kernel structure  figure contains a dispatch table that holds pointers to the appropriate  routines depending on the type of file  some operating systems use object oriented methods even more exten\\xad sively for instance windows nt uses a message passing implementation for  i an i request is converted into a message that is sent through the kernel  to the ii manager and then to the device driver each of which may change the  message contents for output the message contains the data to be written for  input the message contains a buffer to receive the data the message passing  approach can add overhead by comparison with procedural techniques that  use shared data structures but it simplifies the structure and design of the i  system and adds flexibility   kernel i o subsystem summary  in summary the i subsystem coordinates an extensive collection of services  that are available to applications and to other parts of the kernel the i  subsystenc supervises these procedures  management of the name space for files and devices  access control to files and devices  operation control for example a modem cannot seek   file system space allocation  device allocation   chapter   buffering caching and spooling  i scheduling  device status monitoring error handling and failure recovery  device driver configuration and initialization  the upper levels of the i o subsystem access devices via the uniform  interface provided by the device drivers  earlier we described the handshaking between a device driver and a device  controller but we did not explain how the operating system connects an  application request to a set of network wires or to a specific disk sector  consider for example reading a file from disk the application refers to the  data by a file name within a disk the file system maps from the file name  through the file system directories to obtain the space allocation of the file for  instance in ms dos the name maps to a number that indicates an entry in the  file access table and that table entry tells which disk blocks are allocated to  the file in unix the name maps to an inode number and the corresponding  inode contains the space allocation information but how is the connection  made from the file name to the disk controller the hardware port address or  the memory mapped controller registers  one method is that used by ms dos a relatively simple operating system  the first part of an ms dos file name preceding the colon is a string that  identifies a specific hardware device for example c is the first part of every  file name on the primary hard disk the fact that c represents the primary hard  disk is built into the operating system c is mapped to a specific port address  through a device table because of the colon separator the device name space  is separate from the file system name space this separation makes it easy  for the operating system to associate extra functionality with each device for  instance it is easy to invoke spooling on any files written to the printer  if instead the device name space is incorporated in the regular file system  name space as it is in unix the normal file system name services are provided  automatically if the file system provides ownership and access control to all  file names then devices have owners and access control since files are stored  on devices such an interface provides access to the i o system at two levels  names can be used to access the devices themselves or to access the files stored  on the devices  unix represents device names in the regular file system name space unlike  an ms dos file name which has a colon separator a unix path name has no  clear separation of the device portion in fact no part of the path name is the  name of a device unix has a that associates prefixes of path names  with specific device names to resolve a path name unix looks up the name in  the mount table to find the longest ncatchilcg prefix the corresponding entry  in the mount table gives the device name this device name also has the form  of a name in the file system name space when unix looks up this name in  the file system directory structures it finds not an inode number but a major    minor device number the m ajor device number identifies a device driver  that should be called to handle l to this device the minor device number  is passed to the device driver to index into a device table the corresponding  device table entry gives the port address or the memory mapped address of  the device controller  modern operating systems obtain significant flexibility from the multiple  stages of lookup tables in the path between a request and a physical device  controller the mechanisms that pass requests between applications and  drivers are general thus we can introduce new devices and drivers into a  computer without recompiling the kernel in fact some operating systems  have the ability to load device drivers on demand at boot time the system  first probes the hardware buses to determine what devices are present it then  loads in the necessary drivers either immediately or when first required by an  i request  we next describe the typical life cycle of a blocking read request as depicted  in figure the figure suggests that an i operation requires a great many  steps that together consume a tremendous number of cpu cycles  a process issues a blocking read system call to a file descriptor of a file  that has been opened previously  the system call code in the kernel checks the parameters for correctness  in the case of input if the data are already available irl the buffer cache  the data are returned to the process and the i o request is completed  otherwise a physical i must be performed the process is removed  from the run queue and is placed on the wait queue for the device and  the i request is scheduled eventually the i subsystem sends the  request to the device driver depending on the operating system the  request is sent via a subroutine call or an in kernel message  the device driver allocates kernel buffer space to receive the data and  schedules the i eventually the driver sends commands to the device  controller by writing into the device control registers  the device controller operates the device hardware to perform the data  transfer  the driver may poll for status and data or it may have set up a dma  transfer into kernel memory we assume that the transfer is managed  by a dma controller which generates an interrupt when the transfer  completes  the correct interrupt handler receives the interrupt via the interrupt\\xad vector table stores any necessary data signals the device driver and  returns from the interrupt  the device driver receives the signal determines which i request has  completed determines the request s status and signals the kernel i  subsystem that the request has been completed the kernel transfers data or return codes to the address space of the  requesting process and moves the process from the wait queue back to  the ready queue  chapter  system call  device controller commands user  process  kernel  subsystem  kernel  subsystem  device  driver  interrupt  handler  device  controller return from system call  interrupt    tim e   figure the life cycle of an request  moving the process to the ready queue unblocks the process when the  scheduler assigns the process to the cpu the process resumes execution  at the completion of the system call  unix system v has an interesting mechanism called that enables  an application to assemble pipelines of driver code dynamically a stream is  a full duplex connection between a device driver and a user level process it  consists of a that interfaces with the user process that controls the device and zero or more between the stream  user process  i  streams  modules   j  figure the streams structure  head and the driver end each of these components contains a pair of queues   a read queue and a write queue message passing is used to transfer data  between queues the streams structure is shown in figure  modules provide the functionality of streams processing they are pushed  onto a stream by use of the ioctl system call for examplef a process can  open a serial port device via a stream and can push on a module to handle  input editing because messages are exchanged between queues in adjacent  modules a queue in one module may overflow an adjacent queue to prevent  this from occurring a queue may support without flow control  a queue accepts all messages and immediately sends them on to the queue  in the adjacent module without buffering them a queue supporting flow  control buffers messages and does not accept messages without sufficient  buffer space this process involves exchanges of control messages between  queues in adjacent modules  a user process writes data to a device using either the write orputmsg  system call the write system call writes raw data to the stream whereas  putmsg allows the user process to specify a message regardless of the  system call used by the user process the stream head copies the data into a  message and delivers it to the queue for the next module in line this copying of  messages continues until the message is copied to the driver end and hence the  device similarly the user process reads data from the stream head using either  the read or getmsg system call if read is used the stream head gets  a message from its adjacent queue and returns ordinary data an unstructured  byte stream to the process if getmsg is used a message is returned to the  process   chapter   streams i is asynchronous or nonblocking except when the user  process communicates with the stream head when writing to the stream  the user process will block assuming the next queue uses flow controt until  there is room to copy the message likewise the user process will block when  reading from the stream until data are available  as mentioned the driver end like the stream head and modules has  a read and write queue however the driver end must respond to interrupts  such as one triggered when a frame is ready to be read from a network unlike  the stream head which may block if it is unable to copy a message to the  next queue in line the driver end must handle all incoming data drivers  must support flow control as well however if a device s buffer is fult the  device typically resorts to dropping incoming messages consider a network  card whose input buffer is full the network card must simply drop further  messages until there is ample buffer space to store incoming messages  the benefit of using streams is that it provides a framework for a  modular and incremental approach to writing device drivers and network  protocols modules may be used by different streams and hence by different  devices for example a networking module may be used by both an ethernet  network card and a wireless network card furthermore rather than  treating character device i o as an unstructured byte stream streams allows  support for message boundaries and control information when communicating  between modules most unix variants support streams and it is the preferred  method for writing protocols and device drivers for example system v unix  and solaris implement the socket mechanism using streams  i is a major factor in system performance it places heavy demands on the cpu  to execute device driver code and to schedule processes fairly and efficiently  as they block and unblock the resulting context switches stress the cpu and its  hardware caches i o also exposes any inefficiencies in the interrupt handling  mechanisms in the kernel in addition i o loads down the memory bus during  data copies between controllers and physical memory and again durilcg copies  between kernel buffers and application data space coping gracefully with all  these demands is one of the major concerns of a computer architect  although modern computers can handle many thousands of interrupts per  second interrupt handling is a relatively expensive task each interrupt causes  the system to perform a state change to execute the interrupt handler and then  to restore state programmed i can be more efficient than internjpt driven  i if the number of cycles spent in busy waiting is not excessive an i  completion typically unblocks a process leading to the full overhead of a  context switch  network traffic can also cause a high context switch rate consider for  instance a remote login from one machine to another each character typed  on the local machine must be transported to the remote machine on the local  machine the character is typed a keyboard interrupt is generated and the  character is passed through the interrupt handler to the device driver to the  kernet and then to the user process the user process issues a network i o  system call to send the character to the remote machine the character then    flows into the local kernel through the network layers that construct a network  packet and into the network device driver the network device driver transfers  the packet to the network controller which sends the character and generates  an interrupt the interrupt is passed back up through the kernel to cause the  network l system call to complete  now the remote system s network hardware receives the packet and an  interrupt is generated the character is unpacked from the network protocols  and is given to the appropriate network daemon the network daemon  identifies which remote login session is involved and passes the packet to  the appropriate subdaemon for that session throughout this flow there are  context switches and state switches figure  usually the receiver echoes  the character back to the sender that approach doubles the work  to eliminate the context switches involved in moving each character  between daemons and the kernel the solaris developers reimplemented the  daemon using in kernel threads sun estimates that this improvement  sending system receiving system  figure lntercomputer communications   chapter  increased the maximum number of network logins from a few hundred to a  few thousand on a large server  other systems use separate for terminal i to reduce  the interrupt burden on the main cpu for instance a  can multiplex the traffic from hundreds of remote terminals into one port on a  large computer an is a dedicated special purpose cpu found in  mainframes and in other high end systems the job o£ a channel is to offload  i work from the main cpu the idea is that the cham els keep the data flowing  smoothly while the main cpu remains free to process the data like the device  controllers and dma controllers found in smaller computers a channel can  process more general and sophisticated programs so channels can be tuned  for particular workloads  we can employ several principles to improve the efficiency of i  reduce the number of context switches  reduce the number of times that data must be copied in memory while  passing between device and application  reduce the frequency of interrupts by using large transfers smart con\\xad trollers and polling if busy waiting can be minimized  increase concurrency by using dma knowledgeable controllers or chan\\xad nels to offload simple data copying from the cpu  move processing primitives into hardware to allow their operation in  device controllers to be concurrent with cpu and bus operation  balance cpu memory subsystem bus and i o performance because an  overload in any one area will cause idleness in others  i devices vary greatly in complexity for instance a mouse is simple the  mouse movements and button clicks are converted into numeric values that are  passed from hardware through the mouse device driver to the application by  contrast the functionality provided by the windows nt disk device driver is  complex it not only manages individual disks but also implements raid arrays   section  to do so it converts an application s read or write request into a  coordinated set of disk i operations moreover it implements sophisticated  error handling and data recovery algorithms and takes many steps to optimize  disk performance  where should the i functionality be implemented in the device hard\\xad ware in the device driver or in application software sometimes we observe  the progression depicted in figure  initially we implement experimental i algorithms at the application  level because application code is fexible and application bugs are unlikely  to cause system crashes furthermore by developing code at the applica\\xad tion level we avoid the need to reboot or reload device drivers after every  change to the code an application level implementation can be inefficient  however because of the overhead o£ context switches and because the  application cannot take advantage of internal kernel data structures and     device code hardware  figure device functionality progression  kernel functionality such as efficient in kernel messaging threading and  locking  when an application level algorithm has demonstrated its worth we may  reimplement it in the kernel this can improve performance but the devel\\xad opment effort is more challenging because an operating system kernel is  a large complex software system moreover an in kernel implementa\\xad tion must be thoroughly debugged to avoid data corruption and system  crashes  the highest performance may be obtained through a specialized imple\\xad mentation in hardware either in the device or in the controller the  disadvantages of a hardware implementation include the difficulty and  expense of making further improvements or of fixing bugs the increased  development time months rather than days and the decreased flexibility  for instance a hardware raid controller may not provide any means for  the kernel to influence the order or location of individual block reads and  writes even if the kernel has special information about the workload that  would enable it to improve the i performance  the basic hardware elements involved in i are buses device controllers and  the devices themselves the work of moving data between devices and main  memory is perform ed by the cpu as programmed i or is offloaded to a dma  controller the kernel module that controls a device is a device driver the  system call interface provided to applications is designed to handle several  basic categories of hardware including block devices character devices  memory mapped files network sockets and programmed interval timers the  system calls usually block the processes that issue them but nonblocking and   chapter  asynchronous calls are used by the kernel itself and by applications that must  not sleep while waiting for an i operation to complete  the kernel s i o subsystem provides num erous services among these  are i scheduling buffering caching spooling device reservation and error  handling another service name translation makes the connections between  hardware devices and the symbolic file names used by applications it involves  several levels of mapping that translate from character string names to specific  device drivers and device addresses and then to physical addresses of ii ports  or bus controllers this mapping may occur within the file system name space  as it does in unix or in a separate device name space as it does in ms dos  streams is an implementation and methodology that provides a frame\\xad work for a modular and incremental approach to writing device drivers and  network protocols through streams drivers can be stacked with data passing  through them sequentially and bidirectionally for processing  i o system calls are costly in terms of cpu consumption because of the  many layers of software between a physical device and an application these  layers imply overhead from several sources context switching to cross the  kernel s protection boundary signal and interrupt handling to service the i  devices and the load on the cpu and memory system to copy data between  kernel buffers and application space   write in pseudocode an implementation of virtual clocks including  the queueing and management of timer requests for the kernel and  applications assume that the hardware provides three timer channels   what are the advantages and disadvantages of supporting memory\\xad mapped i to device control registers   typically at the completion of a device i a single interrupt is raised  and appropriately handled by the host processor in certain settings  however the code that is to be executed at the completion of the  i can be broken into two separate pieces the first piece executes  immediately after the i completes and schedules a second interrupt  for the remaining piece of code to be executed at a later

multiprogrammed systems user programs access memory  through virtual addresses while the operating system uses raw phys\\xad ical addresses to access menry what are the implications of this  design for the initiation of i operations by the user program and  their execution by the operating system   polling for an i completion can waste a large number of cpu cycles  if the processor iterates a busy waiting loop many times before the i  completes but if the i device is ready for service polling can be much  more efficient than is catching and dispatching an interrupt describe  a hybrid strategy that combines polling sleeping and interrupts for  i device service for each of these three strategies pure polling pure  interrupts hybrid describe a computing environment in which that  strategy is more efficient than is either of the others   consider the following i scenarios on a single user pc  a a mouse used with a graphical user interface  b a tape drive on a multitasking

ensure  that only processes that have gained proper authorization from the  operating system can operate on memory segments the cpu and other  resources  protection is provided by a mechanism that controls the access of  programs processes or users to the resources defined by a computer  system this mechanism must provide a means for specifying the controls  to be imposed together with a means of enforcing them  security ensures the authentication of system users to protect the  integrity of the information stored in the system both data and code  as well as the physical resources of the computer system the security  system prevents unauthorized access malicious destruction alteration  of data and accidental introduction of inconsistency    chapter  the processes in an operating system must be protected from one another s  activities to provide such protection we can use various mechanisms to ensure  that only processes that have gained proper authorization from the operating  system can operate on the files memory segments cpu and other resources  of a system  protection refers to a mechanism for controlling the access of programs  processes or users to the resources defined by a computer system this  mechanism must provide a means for specifying the controls to be imposed  together with a means of enforcement we distinguish between protection and  security which is a measure of confidence that the integrity of a system and  its data will be preserved in this chapter we focus on protection security  assurance is a much broader topic and we address it in chapter  to discuss the goals and principles of protection in a modern computer  system   to explain how protection domains combined with an access matrix are  used to specify the resources a process may access  to examine capability and language based protection systems  as computer systems have become more sophisticated and pervasive in their  applications the need to protect their integrity has also grown protection was  originally conceived as an adjunct to multiprogramming operating systems  so that untrustworthy users might safely share a common logical name space  such as a directory of files or share a common physical name space such as  memory modern protection concepts have evolved to increase the reliability  of any complex system that makes use of shared resources  we need to provide protection for several reasons the most obvious is the  need to prevent the mischievous intentional violation of an access restriction     chapter   by a user of more general importance however is the need to ensure that  each program component active in a system uses system resources only in  ways consistent with stated policies this requirement is an absolute one for a  reliable system  protection can improve reliability by detecting latent errors at the interfaces  between component subsystems early detection of interface errors can often  prevent contamination of a healthy subsystem by a malfunctioning subsystem  also an unprotected resource cannot defend against use or misuse by an  unauthorized or incompetent user a protection oriented system provides  means to distinguish between authorized and unauthorized usage  the role of protection in a computer system is to provide a mechanism for  the enforcement of the policies governing resource use these policies can be  established in a variety of ways some are fixed in the design of the system  while others are formulated by the management of a system still others are  defined by the individual users to protect their own files and programs a  protection system must have the flexibility to enforce a variety of policies  policies for resource use may vary by application and they may change  over time for these reasons protection is no longer the concern solely of  the designer of an operating system the application programmer needs to  use protection mechanisms as well to guard resources created and supported  by an application subsystem against misuse in this chapter we describe the  protection mechanisms the operating system should provide but application  designers can use them as well in designing their own protection software  note that mechanisms are distinct from policies mechanisms determine how  something will be done policies decide what will be done the separation  of policy and mechanism is important for flexibility policies are likely to  change from place to place or time to time in the worst case every change  in policy would require a change in the underlying mechanism using general  mechanisms enables us to avoid such a situation  frequently a guiding principle can be used throughout a project such as  the design of an operating system following this principle simplifies design  decisions and keeps the system consistent and easy to understand a key  time tested guiding principle for protection is the it  dictates that programs users and even systems be given just enough privileges  to perform their tasks  consider the analogy of a security guard with a passkey if this key allows  the guard into just the public areas that she guards then misuse of the key  will result in minimal damage if however the passkey allows access to all  areas then damage from its being lost stolen misused copied or otherwise  compromised will be much greater  an operating system following the principle of least privilege implements  its features programs system calls and data structures so that failure or  compromise of a component does the minimum damage and allows the  ninimum damage to be done the overflow of a buffer in a system daemon  might cause the daemon process to fail for example but should not allow the  execution of code from the daemon process s stack that would enable a remote     user to gain maximum privileges and access to the entire system as happens  too often today  such an operating system also provides system calls and services that  allow applications to be written with fine grained access controls it provides  mechanisms to enable privileges when they are needed and to disable them  when they are not needed also beneficial is the creation of audit trails for  all privileged function access the audit trail allows the prograrnmer systems  administrator or law enforcement officer to trace all protection and security  activities on the system  managing users with the principle of least privilege entails creating a  separate account for each user with just the privileges that the user needs an  operator who needs to mount tapes and back up files on the system has access  to just those commands and files needed to accomplish the job some systems  implement role based access control rbac to provide this functionality  computers implemented in a computing facility under the principle of least  privilege can be limited to running specific services accessing specific remote  hosts via specific services and doing so during specific times typically these  restrictions are implemented through enabling or disabling each service and  through using access control lists as described in sections and  the principle of least privilege can help produce a more secure computing  environment unfortunately it frequently does not for example windows   has a complex protection scheme at its core and yet has many security  holes by comparison solaris is considered relatively secure even though it  is a variant of unix which historically was designed with little protection  in mind one reason for the difference may be that windows has more  lines of code and more services than solaris and thus has more to secure and  protect another reason could be that the protection scheme in windows  is irtcomplete or protects the wrong aspects of the operating system leaving  other areas vulnerable  a computer system is a collection of processes and objects by objects we mean  both such as the cpu memory segments printers disks and  tape drives and such as files programs and semaphores  each object has a unique name that differentiates it from all other objects in the  system and each can be accessed only through well defined and meaningful  operations objects are essentially abstract data types  the operations that are possible may depend on the object for example  on a cpu we can only execute memory segments can be read and written  whereas a cd rom or dvd rom can only be read tape drives can be read  written and rewound data files can be created opened read written closed  and deleted program files can be read written executed and deleted  a process should be allowed to access only those resources for which it  has authorization furthermore at any time a process should be able to access  only those resojrces that it currently reqllires to complete its task this second  requirement conunonly referred to as the need to know principle is useful in  limiting the amount of damage a faulty process can cause in the system for  example when process p invokes procedure a the procedure should be   chapter  allowed to access only its own variables and the formal parameters passed  to it it should not be able to access all the variables of process p similarly  consider the case in which process p invokes a compiler to compile a particular  file the compiler should not be able to access files arbitrarily but should have  access only to a well defined subset of files such as the source file listing file  and so on related to the file to be compiled conversely the compiler may have  private files used for accounting or optimization purposes that process p should  not be able to access the need to know principle is similar to the principle of  least privilege discussed in section in that the goals of protection are to  minimize the risks of possible security violations   domain structure  to facilitate the scheme just described a process operates within a  which specifies the resources that the process may access each  domain defines a set of objects and the types of operations that may be invoked  on each object the ability to execute an operation on an object is an  a domain is a collection of access rights each of which is an ordered pair   object name rights set for example if domain d has the access right file f   read write then a process executing in domain d can both read and write  file f it cannot however perform any other operation on that object  domains do not need to be disjoint they may share access rights for  example in figure we have three domains d d and d the access  right  print is shared by d and d implying that a process executing  in either of these two domains can print object note that a process must be  executing in domain d to read and write object while only processes in  domain d may execute object  the association between a process and a domain may be either if  the set of resources available to the process is fixed throughout the process s  lifetime or as might be expected establishing dynamic protection  domains is more complicated than establishing static protection domains  if the association between processes and domains is fixed and we want to  adhere to the need to know principle then a mechanism must be available to  change the content of a domain the reason stems from the fact that a process  may execute in two different phases and may for example need read access  in one phase and write access in another if a domain is static we must define  the domain to include both read and write access however this arrangement  provides more rights than are needed in each of the two phases since we have  read access in the phase where we need only write access and vice versa  thus the need to know principle is violated we must allow the contents of    read write    read write    execute   write • execute    read  figure system with three protection domains    a domain to be modified so that the domain always reflects the ninimum  necessary access rights  if the association is dynamic a mechanism is available to allow  enabling the process to switch from one domain to another we may  also want to allow the content of a domain to be changed if we cannot change  the content of a domain we can provide the same effect by creating a new  domain with the changed content and switching to that new domain when we  want to change the domain content  a domain can be realized in a variety of ways  each user may be a domain in this case the set of objects that can be  accessed depends on the identity of the user domain switching occurs  when the user is changed generally when one user logs out and another  user logs in  each process may be a domain in this case the set of objects that can be  accessed depends on the identity of the process domain switching occurs  when one process sends a message to another process and then waits for  a response  each procedure may be a domain in this case the set of objects that can be  accessed corresponds to the local variables defined within the procedure  domain switching occurs when a procedure call is made  we discuss domain switching in greater detail in section  consider the standard dual mode monitor user mode model of  operating system execution when a process executes in monitor mode it  can execute privileged instructions and thus gain complete control of the  computer system in contrast when a process executes in user mode it can  invoke only nonprivileged instructions consequently it can execute only  within its predefined memory space these two modes protect the operating  system executing in monitor domain from the user processes executing  in user domain in a multiprogrammed operating system two protection  domains are insufficient since users also want to be protected from one  another therefore a more elaborate scheme is needed we illustrate such a  scheme by examining two influential operating systems unix and multics   to see how they implement these concepts   an example unix  in the unix operating system a domain is associated with the user switching  the domain corresponds to changing the user identification temporarily  this change is accomplished tbough the file system as follows an owner  identification and a domain bit known as the setuid bit are associated with  each file when the setuid bit is on and a user executes that file the user id is  set to that of the owner of the file when the bit is off however the user id does  not change for example when a user a that is a user with userid a starts  executing a file owned by b whose associated domain bit is off the userid of  the process is set to a when the setuid bit is on the userid is set to that of  the owner of the file b when the process exits this temporary userid change  ends   chapter  other methods are used to change domains in operating systems in which  user ids are used for domain definition because almost all systems need  to provide such a mechanism this mechanism is used when an otherwise  privileged facility needs to be made available to the general user population  for instance it might be desirable to allow users to access a network without  letting them write their own networking programs in such a case on a unix  system the setuid bit on a networking program would be set causing the user  ld to change when the program was run the user ld would change to that  of a user with network access privilege such as root the most powerful user  id one problem with this method is that if a user manages to create a file  with user id root and with its setuid bit on that user can become root and do  anything and everything on the system the setuid mechanism is discussed  further in appendix a  an alternative to this method used in other operating systems is to place  privileged programs in a special directory the operating system would be  designed to change the user ld of any program run from this directory either  to the equivalent of root or to the user ld of the owner of the directory this  eliminates one security problem with setuid programs in which crackers create  and hide such programs for later use using obscure file or directory names  this method is less flexible than that used in unix however  even more restrictive and thus more protective are systems that simply  do not allow a change of user id in these instances special techniques must  be used to allow users access to privileged facilities for instance a  may be started at boot time and run as a special user id users then  run a separate program which sends requests to this process whenever they  need to use the facility this method is used by the tops operating system  in any of these systems great care must be taken in writing privileged  programs any oversight can result in a total lack of protection on the system  generally these programs are the first to be attacked by people trying to  break into a system unfortunately the attackers are frequently successful  for example security has been breached on many unix systems because of the  setuid feature we discuss security in chapter   an example mul tics  in the multics system the protection domains are organized hierarchically  into a ring structure each ring corresponds to a single domain figure   the rings are numbered from to let d and dj be any two domain rings  if j i then d is a subset of dj that is a process executing in domain dj  has more privileges than does a process executing in domain d a process  executing in domain do has the most privileges if only two rings exist this  scheme is equivalent to the monitor user node of execution where monitor  mode corresponds to do and user mode corresponds to d  multics has a segmented address space each segment is a file and each  segment is associated with one of the rings a segm ent description includes an  entry that identifies the ring number in addition it includes three access bits  to control reading writing and execution the association between segments  and rings is a policy decision with which we are not concerned here  a current ring number counter is associated with each process identifying  the ring in which the process is executing currently when a process is executing    figure multics ring structure  in ring i it cmmot access a segment associated with ring j j i it can access a  segment associated with ring k k i the type of access however is restricted  according to the access bits associated with that segment  domain switching in multics occurs when a process crosses from one ring  to another by calling a procedure in a different ring obviously this switch must  be done in a controlled mmmer otherwise a process could start executing in  ring and no protection would be provided to allow controlled domain  switching we modify the ring field of the segment descriptor to include the  following  access bracket a pair of integers bl and b such that bl  b  limit an integer b such that b b  list of gates identifies the entry points or  may be called at which the segments  if a process executing in ring i calls a procedure or segncent with access bracket   bl b then the call is allowed if bl  i  b and the current ring number of  the process remains i otherwise a trap to the operating system occurs and  the situation is handled as follows  if i bl then the call is allowed to occur because we have a transfer to a  ring or domain with fewer privileges however if parameters are passed  that refer to segments in a lower ring that is segments not accessible to  the called procedure then these segments must be copied into an area  that can be accessed by the called procedure  if i b then the call is allowed to occur only if b is greater than or equal  to i and the call has been directed to one of the designated entry points in  the list of gates this scheme allows processes with limited access rights to  call procedures in lower rings that have more access rights but only in a  carefully controlled mmmer   chapter   the main disadvantage of the ring or hierarchical structure is that it does  not allow us to enforce the need to know principle in particular if an object  must be accessible in domain j but not accessible in domain oi then we must  have j i but this requirement means that every segment accessible in oi is  also accessible in  the multics protection system is generally more complex and less efficient  than are those used in current operating systems if protection interferes with  the ease of use of the system or significantly decreases system performance  then its use must be weighed carefully against the purpose of the system for  instance we would want to have a complex protection system on a computer  used by a university to process students grades and also used by students for  classwork a similar protection system would not be suited to a computer being  used for number crunching in which performance is of utmost importance we  would prefer to separate the mechanism from the protection policy allowing  the same system to have complex or simple protection depending on the needs  of its users to separate mechanism from policy we require a more general  model of protection  our model of protection can be viewed abstractly as a matrix called an  the rows of the access matrix represent domains and the columns  represent objects each entry in the matrix consists of a set of access rights  because the column defines objects explicitly we can omit the object name  from the access right the entry access i j defines the set of operations that a  process executing in domain oi can invoke on object oj  to illustrate these concepts we consider the access matrix shown in figure   there are four domains and four objects three files f f f and one  laser printer a process executing in domain can read files f and f a  process executing in domain has the same privileges as one executing in  domain but in addition it can also write onto files f and f note that the  laser printer can be accessed only by a process executing in domain  the access matrix scheme provides us with the mechanism for specifying  a variety of policies the mechanism consists of implementing the access   read read   print   read execute   read read  write write  figure access matrix    matrix and ensuring that the semantic properties we have outlined hold  more specifically we must ensure that a process executing in domain n can  access only those objects specified in row and then only as allowed by the  access matrix entries  the access matrix can implement policy decisions concerning protection  the policy decisions involve which rights should be included in the i j th  entry we must also decide the domain in which each process executes this  last policy is usually decided by the operating system  the users normally decide the contents of the access matrix entries when  a user creates a new object oi the column oi is added to the access matrix  with the appropriate initialization entries as dictated by the creator the user  may decide to enter some rights in some entries in cohum j and other rights  in other entries as needed  the access matrix provides an appropriate mechanism for defining and  implementing strict control for both the static and dynamic association between  processes and domains when we switch a process from one domain to another  we are executing an operation switch on an object the domain we can  control domain switching by including domains among the objects of the  access matrix similarly when we change the content of the access matrix  we are performing an operation on an object the access matrix again we  can control these changes by including the access matrix itself as an object  actually since each entry in the access matrix may be modified individually  we must consider each entry in the access matrix as an object to be protected  now we need to consider only the operations possible on these new objects   domains and the access matrix and decide how we want processes to be able  to execute these operations  processes should be able to switch from one domain to another switching  from domain d to domain di is allowed if and only if the access right switch  e access i j thus in figure a process executing in domain d can switch  to domain d or to domain d a process in domain d can switch to d and  one in domain d can switch to d  allowing controlled change in the contents of the access matrix entries  requires three additional operations copy owner and control we examine  these operations next   read read switch   print switch switch   read execute   read read switch write write  figure access matrix of figure with domains as objects   chapter   a  execute read execute  execute read   b  figure access matrix with copy rights  the ability to copy an access right from one domain or row of the access  matrix to another is denoted by an asterisk  appended to the access right  the copy right allows the access right to be copied only within the colurrm   that is for the object for which the right is defined for example in figure   a a process executing in domain d can copy the read operation into any  entry associated with file f hence the access matrix of figure a can be  modified to the access matrix shown in figure b  this scheme has two variants  a right is copied from access i j to access jc j it is then removed from  access i j this action is a transfer of a right rather than a copy  propagation of the copy right may be limited that is when the right  r is copied from access i j to access lc j only the right r not r  is created a process executing in domain d r cannot further copy the  right r  a system may select only one of these three copy rights or it may provide all  three by identifying them as separate rights copy transfer and limited copy  we also need a mechanism to allow addition of new rights and removal of  some rights the owner right controls these operations if access i j includes  the owner right then a process executing in domain di can add and remove  any right in any entry in column j for example in figure a domain d  is the owner of f and thus can add and delete any valid right in column f  similarly domain d is the owner of f and f and thus can add and remove  any valid right within these two columns thus the access matrix of figure   a can be modified to the access matrix shown in figure b     owner write execute  read read   owner owner write   execute   a   owner write execute  owner read   read owner  write write   write write   b  figure access matrix with owner rights  the copy and owner rights allow a process to change the entries in a column  a mechanism is also needed to change the entries in a row the control right  is applicable only to domain objects if access i j includes the control right  then a process executing in domain di can remove any access right from  row j for example suppose that in figure we include the control right in  access d d then a process executil g in domain d could modify domai  d as shown in figure  read read switch  print switch switch  control  read execute  write write switch  figure modified access matrix of figure   chapter   the copy and owner rights provide us with a mechanism to limit the  propagation of access rights however they do not give us the appropriate tools  for preventing the propagation or disclosure of information the problem of  guaranteeing that no information initially held in an object can migrate outside  of its execution environment is called the this problem  is in general unsolvable see the bibliographical notes at the end of the chapter  these operations on the domains and the access matrix are not in them\\xad selves important but they illustrate the ability of the access matrix model to  allow the implementation and control of dynamic protection requirements  new objects and new domains can be created dynamically and included in the  access matrix model however we have shown only that the basic mechanism  exists system designers and users must make the policy decisions concerning  which domains are to have access to which objects in which ways  how can the access matrix be implemented effectively in general the matrix  will be sparse that is most of the entries will be empty although data\\xad structure techniques are available for representing sparse matrices they are  not particularly useful for this application because of the way in which  the protection facility is used here we first describe several methods of  implementing the access matrix and then compare the methods   global table  the simplest implementation of the access matrix is a global table consisting  of a set of ordered triples domain object rights set whenever an operation  m is executed on an object oj within domain d the global table is searched  for a triple d  r c with me r c if this triple is found the operation is  allowed to continue otherwise an exception or error condition is raised  this implementation suffers from several drawbacks the table is usually  large and thus cannot be kept in main memory so additional i is needed  virtual memory techniques are often used for managing this table in addition  it is difficult to take advantage of special groupings of objects or domains  for example if everyone can read a particular object this object must have a  separate entry in every domain   access lists for objects  each column in the access matrix can be implemented as an access list for  one object as described in section  obviously the empty entries can be  discarded the resulting list for each object consists of ordered pairs domain  rights set which define all domains with a nonempty set of access rights for  that object  this approach can be extended easily to define a list plus a default set of  access rights when an operation m on an object oi is attempted in domain  d we search the access list for object i looking for an entry d rc with  me rjc if the entry is found we allow the operation if it is not we check the  default set if m is in the default set we allow the access otherwise access is    denied and an exception condition occurs for efficiency we may check the  default set first and then search the access list   capability lists for domains  rather than associating the columns of the access matrix with the objects as  access lists we can associate each row with its domain a ltst for  a domain is a list of objects together with the operations allowed on tbose  objects an object is often represented by its physical name or address called  a to execute operation m on object the process executes the  operation m specifying the capability or pointer for object j as a parameter  simple of the capability means that access is allowed  the capability list is associated with a domain but it is never directly  accessible to a process executing in that domain rather the capability list  is itself a protected object maintained by the operating system and accessed  by the user only indirectly capability based protection relies on the fact that  the capabilities are never allowed to migrate into any address space directly  accessible by a user process where they could be modified if all capabilities  are secure the object they protect is also secure against unauthorized access  capabilities were originally proposed as a kind of secure pointer to  meet the need for resource protection that was foreseen as multiprogrammed  computer systems came of age the idea of an inherently protected pointer  provides a fomdation for protection that can be extended up to the applications  level  to provide inherent protection we must distinguish capabilities from other  kinds of objects and they must be interpreted by an abstract machine on which  higher level programs run capabilities are usually distinguished from other  data in one of two ways  each object has a to denote whether it is a capability or accessible  data the tags themselves must not be directly accessible by an application  program hardware or firmware support may be used to enforce this  restriction although only one bit is necessary to distinguish between  capabilities and other objects more bits are often used this extension  allows all objects to be tagged with their types by the hardware thus  the hardware can distinguish integers floating point numbers pointers  booleans characters instructions capabilities and uninitialized values by  their tags  alternatively the address space associated with a program can be split into  two parts one part is accessible to the program and contains the program s  normal data and instructions the other part containing the capability list  is accessible only by the operating system a segmented memory space   section is useful to support this approach  several capability based protection systems have been developed we describe  them briefly in section the mach operating system also uses a version of  capability based protection it is described in appendix b   chapter   a lock key mechanism  the t is a compromise between access lists and capability  lists each object has a list of unique bit patterns called similarly each  domain has a list of unique bit patterns called a process executing in a  domain can access an object only if that domain has a key that matches one of  the locks of the object  as with capability lists the list of keys for a domain must be managed  by the operating system on behalf of the domain users are not allowed to  examine or modify the list of keys or locks directly   comparison  as you might expect choosing a technique for implementing an access matrix  involves various trade offs using a global table is simple however the table  can be quite large and often cannot take advantage of special groupings of  objects or domains access lists correspond directly to the needs of users  when a user creates an object he can specify which domains can access the  object as well as what operations are allowed however because access rights  information for a particular domain is not localized determining the set of  access rights for each domain is difficult in addition every access to the object  must be checked requiring a search of the access list in a large system with  long access lists this search can be time consuming  capability lists do not correspond directly to the needs of users they  are usefut however for localizing information for a given process the  process attempting access must present a capability for that access then the  protection system needs only to verify that the capability is valid revocation  of capabilities however may be inefficient section   the lock key mechanism as mentioned is a compromise between access  lists and capability lists the mechanism can be both effective and flexible  depending on the length of the keys the keys can be passed freely from  domain to domain in addition access privileges can be effectively revoked by  the simple technique of changing some of the locks associated with the object   section   most systems use a combination of access lists and capabilities when a  process first tries to access an object the access list is searched if access is  denied an exception condition occurs otherwise a capability is created and  attached to the process additional references use the capability to demonstrate  swiftly that access is allowed after the last access the capability is destroyed  this strategy is used in the multics system and in the cal system  as an example of how such a strategy works consider a file system in  which each file has an associated access list when a process opens a file the  directory structure is searched to find the file access permission is checked and  buffers are allocated all this information is recorded in a new entry in a file  table associated with the process the operation returns an index into this table  for the newly opened file all operations on the file are made by specification  of the index into the file table the entry in the file table then points to the file  and its buffers when the file is closed the file table entry is deleted since the  file table is maintained by the operating system the user carmot accidentally  corrupt it thus the user can access only those files that have been opened     since access is checked when the file is opened protection is ensured this  strategy is used in the unix system  the right to access must still be checked or each access and the file table  entry has a capability only for the allowed operations if a file is opened for  reading then a capability for read access is placed in the file table entry if  an attempt is made to write onto the file the system identifies this protection  violation by com paring the requested operation with the capability in the  file table entry  in section  we described how access controls can be used on files within a  file system each file and directory are assigned an owner a group or possibly  a list of users and for each of those entities access control information is  assigned a similar function can be added to other aspects of a computer  system a good example of this is found in solaris  solaris advances the protection available in the sun microsystems  operating system by explicitly adding the principle of least privilege via  this facility revolves around privileges  a privilege is the right to execute a system call or to use an option within  that system call such as opening a file with write access privileges can be  assigned to processes limiting them to exactly the access they need to perform  their work privileges and programs can also be assigned to users are  assigned roles or can take roles based on passwords to the roles in this way a  user can take a role that enables a privilege allowing the user to run a program  to accomplish a specific task as depicted in figure this implementation  of privileges decreases the security risk associated with superusers and setuid  programs  user  executes with role privileges    figure role based access control in solaris   chapter   notice that this facility is similar to the access matrix described in section   this relationship is further explored in the exercises at the end of the  chapter  in a dynamic protection system we may sometimes need to revoke access  rights to objects shared by different users various questions about revocation  may arise  immediate versus delayed does revocation occur immediately or is it  delayed if revocation is delayed can we find out when it will take place  selective versus general when an access right to an object is revoked  does it affect all the users who have an access right to that object or can  we specify a select group of users whose access rights should be revoked  partial versus total can a subset of the rights associated with an object be  revoked or must we revoke all access rights for this object  temporary versus permanent can access be revoked permanently that  is the revoked access right will never again be available or can access be  revoked and later be obtained again  with an access list scheme revocation is easy the access list is searched for  any access rights to be revoked and they are deleted from the list revocation  is immediate and can be general or selective total or partial and permanent  or temporary  capabilities however present a much more difficult revocation problem  as mentioned earlier since the capabilities are distributed throughout the  system we must find them before we can revoke them schemes that implement  revocation for capabilities include the following  reacquisition periodically capabilities are deleted from each domain if  a process wants to use a capability it may find that that capability has been  deleted the process may then try to reacquire the capability if access has  been revoked the process will not be able to reacquire the capability  back pointers a list of pointers is maintained with each object pointing  to all capabilities associated with that object when revocation is required  we can follow these pointers changing the capabilities as necessary this  scheme was adopted in the multics system it is quite general but its  implementation is costly  indirection the capabilities point indirectly not directly to the objects  each capability points to a unique entry in a global table which in turn  points to the object we implement revocation by searching the global table  for the desired entry and deleting it then when an access is attempted  the capability is found to point to an illegal table entry table entries can  be reused for other capabilities without difficulty since both the capability  and the table entry contain the unique name of the object the object for a     capability and its table entry must match this scheme was adopted in the  cal system it does not allow selective revocation  keys a key is a unique bit pattern that can be associated with a capability  this key is defined when the capability is created and it can be neither  modified nor inspected by the process that owns the capability a  is associated with each object it can be defined or replaced with  the set key operation when a capability is created the current value  of the master key is associated with the capability when the capability  is exercised its key is compared with the master key if the keys match  the operation is allowed to continue otherwise an exception condition  is raised revocation replaces the master key with a new value via the  set key operation invalidating all previous capabilities for this object  this scheme does not allow selective revocation since only one master  key is associated with each object if we associate a list of keys with each  object then selective revocation can be implemented finally we can group  all keys into one global table of keys a capability is valid only if its  key matches some key in the global table we implement revocation by  removing the matching key from the table with this scheme a key can be  associated with several objects and several keys can be associated with  each object providing maximum flexibility  in key based schemes the operations of defining keys inserting them  into lists and deleting them from lists should not be available to all users  in particular it would be reasonable to allow only the owner of an object  to set the keys for that object this choice however is a policy decision  that the protection system can implement but should not define  in this section we survey two capability based protection systems these  systems differ in their complexity and in the types of policies that can be  implemented on them neither system is widely used but both provide  interesting proving grounds for protection theories   an example hydra  hydra is a capability based protection system that provides considerable  flexibility the system implements a fixed set of possible access rights including  such basic forms of access as the right to read write or execute a memory  segment in addition a user of the protection system can declare other rights  the interpretation of user defined rights is performed solely by the user s  program but the system provides access protection for the use of these rights  as well as for the use of system defined rights these facilities constitute a  significant development in protection technology  operations on objects are defined procedurally the procedures that  implement such operations are themselves a form of object and they are  accessed indirectly by capabilities the names of user defined procedures must  be identified to the protection system if it is to deal with objects of the user\\xad defined type when the definition of an object is made krtown to hydra the  names of operations on the type become auxiliary rights   chapter  can be described in a capability for an instance of the type for a process to  perform an operation on a typed object the capability it holds for that object  must contain the name of the operation being invoked among its auxiliary  rights this restriction enables discrin lination of access rights to be made on an  instance by instance and process by process basis  hydra also provides  fnrwk jo l this scheme allows a procedure  to be certified as to act on a formal parameter of a specified type  on behalf of any process that holds a right to execute the procedure the rights  held by a trustworthy procedure are independent oc and may exceed the  rights held by the calling process however such a procedure must not be  regarded as universally trustworthy the procedure is not allowed to act on  other types for instance and the trustworthiness must not be extended to any  other procedures or program segments that might be executed by a process  amplification allows implementation procedures access to the representa\\xad tion variables of an abstract data type if a process holds a capability to a typed  object a for instance this capability may include an auxiliary right to invoke  some operation p but does not include any of the so called kernel rights such  as read write or execute on the segment that represents a such a capability  gives a process a means of indirect access through the operation p to the  representation of a but only for specific purposes  when a process invokes the operation p on an object a however the  capability for access to a may be amplified as control passes to the code body  of p this amplification may be necessary to allow p the right to access the  storage segment representing a so as to implement the operation that p defines  on the abstract data type the code body of p may be allowed to read or to  write to the segment of a directly even though the calling process cmmot  on return from p the capability for a is restored to its originat unamplified  state this case is a typical one in which the rights held by a process for access  to a protected segment must change dynamically depending on the task to  be performed the dynamic adjustment of rights is performed to guarantee  consistency of a programmer defined abstraction amplification of rights can  be stated explicitly in the declaration of an abstract type to the hydra operating  system  when a user passes an object as an argument to a procedure we may need  to ensure that the procedure cannot modify the object we can implement this  restriction readily by passing an access right that does not have the modification   write right however if amplification may occur the right to modify may  be reinstated thus the user protection requirement can be circumvented  in generat of course a user may trust that a procedure performs its task  correctly this assumption is not always correct however because of hardware  or software errors hydra solves this problem by restricting amplifications  the procedure call mechanism of hydra was designed as a direct solution  to the problem of mutually suspicious subsystems this problem is defined as  follows suppose that a program is provided that can be invoked as a service  by a number of different users for example a sort routine a compiler a  game when users invoke this service program they take the risk that the  program will malfunction and will either damage the given data or retain  some access right to the data to be used without authority later similarly  the service program may have som e private files for accounting purposes    for example that should not be accessed directly by the calling user program  hydra provides mechanisms for directly dealing with this problem  a hydra subsystem is built on top of its protection kernel and may require  protection of its own components a subsystem interacts with the kernel  through calls on a set of kernel defined primitives that define access rights to  resources defined by the subsystenl the subsystem designer can define policies  for use of these resources by user processes but the policies are enforceable by  use of the standard access protection afforded by the capability system  programmers can make direct use of the protection system after acquaint\\xad ing themselves with its features in the appropriate reference rnanual hydra  provides a large library of system defined procedures that can be called by  user programs programmers can explicitly incorporate calls on these system  procedures into their program code or can use a program translator that has  been interfaced to hydra   an example cambridge cap system  a different approach to capability based protection has been taken in the  design of the cambridge cap system cap s capability system is simpler and  superficially less powerful than that of hydra however closer examination  shows that it too can be used to provide secure protection of user defined  objects cap has two kinds of capabilities the ordinary kind is called a   it can be used to provide access to objects but the only  rights provided are the standard read write and execute of the individual  storage segments associated with the object data capabilities are interpreted  by microcode in the cap machine  the second kind of capability is the so called which  is protected but not interpreted by the cap microcode it is interpreted by a  protected that is privileged procedure which may be written by an application  programmer as part of a subsystem a particular kind of rights amplification  is associated with a protected procedure when executing the code body of  such a procedure a process temporarily acquires the right to read or write the  contents of a software capability itself this specific kind of rights amplification  corresponds to an implementation of the seal and unseal primitives on  capabilities of course this privilege is still subject to type verification to ensure  that only software capabilities for a specified abstract type are passed to any  such procedure universal trust is not placed in any code other than the cap  machine s microcode see bibliographical notes for references  the interpretation of a software capability is left completely to the sub\\xad system through the protected procedures it contains this scheme allows a  variety of protection policies to be implemented although programmers can  define their own protected procedures any of which might be incorrect the  security of the overall system cannot be compromised the basic protection  system will not allow an unverified user defined protected procedure access  to any storage segments or capabilities that do not belong to the protection  environment in which it resides the most serious consequence of an insecure  protected procedure is a protection breakdown of the subsystem for which that  procedure has responsibility   chapter   the designers of the cap system have noted that the use of software  capabilities allowed them to realize considerable economies in formulating  and implementing protection policies commensurate with the requirements of  abstract resources however subsystem designers who want to make use of  this facility cannot simply study a reference manual as is the case with hydra  instead they must learn the principles and techniques of protection since the  system provides them with no library of procedures  to the degree that protection is provided in existing computer systems it is  usually achieved through an operating system kernel which acts as a security  agent to inspect and validate each attempt to access a protected resource since  comprehensive access validation may be a source of considerable overhead  either we must give it hardware support to reduce the cost of each validation  or we must allow the system designer to compromise the goals of protection  satisfying all these goals is difficult if the flexibility to implement protection  policies is restricted by the support mechanisms provided or if protection  environments are made larger than necessary to secure greater operational  efficiency  as operating systems have become more complex and particularly as they  have attempted to provide higher level user interfaces the goals of protection  have become much more refined the designers of protection systems have  drawn heavily on ideas that originated in programming languages and  especially on the concepts of abstract data types and objects protection systems  are now concerned not only with the identity of a resource to which access is  attempted but also with the functional nature of that access in the newest  protection systems concern for the function to be invoked extends beyond  a set of system defined functions such as standard file access methods to  include functions that may be user defined as well  policies for resource use may also vary depending on the application  and they may be subject to change over time for these reasons protection  can no longer be considered a matter of concern only to the designer of an  operating system it should also be available as a tool for use by the application  designer so that resources of an applications subsystem can be guarded against  tampering or the influence of an error   compiler based enforcement  at this point programming languages enter the picture specifying the desired  control of access to a shared resource in a system is making a declarative  statement about the resource this kind of statement can be integrated into a  language by an extension of its typing facility when protection is declared  along with data typing the designer of each subsystem can specify its  requirements for protection as well as its need for use of other resources in a  system such a specification should be given directly as a program is composed  and in the language in which the program itself is stated this approach has  several significant advantages    protection needs are simply declared rather than programmed as a  sequence of calls on procedures of an operating system  protection requirements can be stated independently of the facilities  provided by a particular operating system  the means for enforcement need not be provided by the designer of a  subsystem  a declarative notation is natural because access privileges are closely  related to the linguistic concept of data type  a variety of techniques can be provided by a programming language  implementation to enforce protection but any of these must depend on some  degree of support from an underlying machine and its operating system for  example suppose a language is used to generate code to run on the cambridge  cap system on this system every storage reference made on the underlying  hardware occurs indirectly through a capability this restriction prevents any  process from accessing a resource outside of its protection environment at  any time however a program may impose arbitrary restrictions on how  a resource can be used during execution of a particular code segment  we can implement such restrictions most readily by usin g the software  capabilities provided by cap a language implementation might provide  standard protected procedures to interpret software capabilities that would  realize the protection policies that could be specified in the language this  scheme puts policy specification at the disposal of the programmers while  freeing them from implementing its enforcement  even if a system does not provide a protection kernel as powerful as those  of hydra or cap mechanisms are still available for implementing protection  specifications given in a programming language the principal distinction is  that the security of this protection will not be as great as that supported by  a protection kernel because the mechanism must rely on more assumptions  about the operational state of the system a compiler can separate references  for which it can certify that no protection violation could occur from those  for which a violation might be possible and it can treat them differently the  security provided by this form of protection rests on the assumption that the  code generated by the compiler will not be modified prior to or during its  execution  what then are the relative merits of enforcement based solely on a kernel  as opposed to enforcement provided largely by a compiler  security enforcement by a kernel provides a greater degree of security  of the protection system itself than does the generation of protection\\xad checking code by a compiler in a compiler supported scheme security  rests on correctness of the translator on some underlying mechanism of  storage management that protects the segments from which compiled  code is executed and ultimately on the security of files from which a  program is loaded some of these considerations also apply to a software\\xad supported protection kernel but to a lesser degree since the kernel may  reside in fixed physical storage segments and may be loaded only from  a designated file with a tagged capability system in which all address   chapter  computation is performed either by hardware or by a fixed microprogram  even greater security is possible hardware supported protection is also  relatively immune to protection violations that might occur as a result of  either hardware or system software malfunction  flexibility there are limits to the flexibility of a protection kernel in  implementing a user defined policy although it may supply adequate  facilities for the system to provide enforcement of its own policies  with a programming language protection policy can be declared and  enforcem ent provided as needed by an implementation if a language  does not provide sufficient flexibility it can be extended or replaced with  less disturbance of a system in service than would be caused by the  modification of an operating system kernel  efficiency the greatest efficiency is obtained when enforcement of protec\\xad tion is supported directly by hardware or microcode insofar as software  support is required language based enforcement has the advantage that  static access enforcement can be verified off line at compile time also  since an intelligent compiler can tailor the enforcement mechanism to  meet the specified need the fixed overhead of kernel calls can often be  avoided  in summary the specification of protection in a programming language  allows the high level description of policies for the allocation and use of  resources a language implementation can provide software for protection  enforcement when automatic hardware supported checking is unavailable in  addition it can interpret protection specifications to generate calls on whatever  protection system is provided by the hardware and the operating system  one way of making protection available to the application program is  through the use of a software capability that could be used as an object  of computation inherent in this concept is the idea that certain program  components might have the privilege of creating or examining these software  capabilities a capability creating program would be able to execute a primitive  operation that would seal a data structure rendering the latter s contents  inaccessible to any program components that did not hold either the seal or  the unseal privilege such components might copy the data structure or pass  its address to other program components but they could not gain access to  its contents the reason for introducing such software capabilities is to bring a  protection mechanism into the programming language the only problem with  the concept as proposed is that the use of the seal and unseal operations takes  a procedural approach to specifying protection a nonprocedural or declarative  notation seems a preferable way to make protection available to the application  programmer  what is needed is a safe dynamic access control mechanism for distribut\\xad ing capabilities to system resources among user processes to contribute to the  overall reliability of a system the access control mechanism should be safe  to use to be useful in practice it should also be reasonably efficient this  requirement has led to the development of a number of language constructs  that allow the programmer to declare various restrictions on the use of a specific  managed resource see the bibliographical notes for appropriate references  these constructs provide mechanisms for three functions    distributing capabilities safely and efficiently among customer processes  in particular mechanisms ensure that a user process will use the managed  resource only if it was granted a capability to that resource  specifying the type of operations that a particular process may invoke on  an allocated resource for example a reader of a file should be allowed  only to read the file whereas a writer should be able both to read and  to write it should not be necessary to grant the same set of rights to  every user process and it should be impossible for a process to enlarge  its set of access rights except with the authorization of the access control  mechanism  specifying the order in which a particular process may invoke the various  operations of a resource for example a file must be opened before it can  be read it should be possible to give two processes different restrictions  on the order in which they can invoke the operations of the allocated  resource  the incorporation of protection concepts into programming languages as  a practical tool for system design is in its infancy protection will likely become  a matter of greater concern to the designers of new systems with distributed  architectures and increasingly stringent requirements on data security then  the importance of suitable language notations in which to express protection  requirements will be recognized more widely   protection in java  because java was designed to run in a distributed environment the java  virtual machine or jvm has many built in protection mechanisms java  programs are composed of each of which is a collection of data fields  and functions called that operate on those fields the jvm loads a  class in response to a request to create instances or objects of that class one of  the most novel and useful features ofj ava is its support for dynamically loading  untrusted classes over a network and for executing mutually distrusting classes  within the same jvm  because of these capabilities of java protection is a paramount concern  classes running in the same jvm may be from different sources and may not  be equally trusted as a result enforcing protection at the granularity of the  jvm process is insufficient intuitively whether a request to open a file should  be allowed will generally depend on which class has requested the open the  operating system lacks this knowledge  thus such protection decisions are handled within the jvm when the  jvm loads a class it assigns the class to a protection domain that gives  the permissions of that class the protection domain to which the class is  assigned depends on the url from which the class was loaded and any digital  signatures on the class file digital signatures are covered in section   a configurable policy file determines the permissions granted to the domain   and its classes for example classes loaded from a trusted server might be  placed in a protection domain that allows them to access files in the user s  home directory whereas classes loaded from an untrusted server might have  no file access permissions at all   chapter  it can be complicated for the jvm to determine what class is responsible for a  request to access a protected resource accesses are often performed indirectly  through system libraries or other classes for example consider a class that  is not allowed to open network connections it could call a system library to  request the load of the contents of a url the jvm must decide whether or not  to open a network connection for this request but which class should be used  to determine if the connection should be allowed the application or the system  library  the philosophy adopted in java is to require the library class to explicitly  permit a network corucection more generally in order to access a protected  resource some method in the calling sequence that resulted in the request must  explicitly assert the privilege to access the resource by doing so this method  takes responsibility for the request presumably it will also perform whatever  checks are necessary to ensure the safety of the request of course not every  method is allowed to assert a privilege a method can assert a privilege only if  its class is in a protection domain that is itself allowed to exercise the privilege  this implementation approach is called every thread  in the jvm has an associated stack of its ongoing invocations when  a caller may not be trusted a method executes an access request within a  dopri vileged block to perform the access to a protected resource directly or  indirectly dopri vileged is a static method in the accesscontroller class  that is passed a class with a run method to invoke when the dopri vileged  block is entered the stack frame for this method is annotated to indicate this  fact then the contents of the block are executed when an access to a protected  resource is subsequently requested either by this method or a method it  calls a call to checkpermissions is used to invoke stack inspection to  determine if the request should be allowed the inspection examines stack  frames on the calling thread s stack starting from the most recently added  frame and working toward the oldest if a stack frame is first found that has the  dopri vileged annotation then checkpermissions returns immediately  and silently allowing the access if a stack frame is first found for which  access is disallowed based on the protection domain of the method s class  then checkpermissions throws an accesscontrolexception if the stack  inspection exhausts the stack without finding either type of frame then  whether access is allowed depends on the implementation for example some  implementations of the jvm may allow access while other implementations  may disallow it  stack inspection is illustrated in figure here the gui method of  a class in the untrusted applet protection domain performs two operations  first a get and then an open  the former is an invocation of the  get method of a class in the url loader protection domain which is  permitted to open sessions to sites in the lucent com domain in particular  a proxy server proxy lucent com for retrieving urls for this reason the  untrusted applet s get invocation will succeed the checkpermissions  call in the networking library encounters the stack frame of the get  method which performed its open in a dopri vileged block however  the untrusted applet s open invocation will result in an exception because  the checkpermissions call finds no dopri vileged annotation before  encountering the stack frame of the gui method   protection  domain  socket  permission  class none  gui  get uri  open addr    lucent com connect  get url u  doprivileged  open proxy lucent com      request u from proxy  figure stack inspection  any  open addr a  checkpermission   a connect  connect a  of course for stack inspection to work a program must be unable to  modify the annotations on its own stack frame or to do other manipulations  of stack inspection this is one of the most important differences between  java and many other languages including c  a java program cannot  directly access memory it can manipulate only an object for which it has  a reference references cannot be forged and the manipulations are made  only through well defined interfaces compliance is enforced through a  sophisticated collection of load time and run time checks as a result an object  cannot manipulate its run time stack because it camlot get a reference to the  stack or other components of the protection system  more generally java s load time and run time checks enforce of  java classes type safety ensures that classes cannot treat integers as pointers  write past the end of an array or otherwise access memory in arbitrary ways  rather a program can access an object only via the methods defined on that  object by its class this is the fmdation of java protection since it enables a  class to effectively and protect its data and methods from other  classes loaded in the same jvm for example a variable can be defined as  private so that only the class that contains it can access it or protected so  that it can be accessed only by the class that contains it subclasses of that class  or classes in the same package type safety ensures that these restrictions can  be enforced  computer systems contain many objects and they need to be protected from  misuse objects may be hardware such as memory cpu time and i devices  or software such as files programs and semaphores an access right is  permission to perform an operation on an object a domain is a set of access  rights processes execute in domains and may use any of the access rights in  the domain to access and manipulate objects during its lifetime a process may  be either bound to a protection domain or allowed to switch from one domain  to another   chapter  the access matrix is a general model of protection that provides a  mechanisnc for protection without imposing a particular protection policy on  the system or its users the separation of policy and mechanism is an important  design property  the access matrix is sparse it is normally implemented either as access lists  associated with each object or as capability lists associated with each domain  we can include dynamic protection in the access matrix model by considering  domains and the access matrix itself as objects revocation of access rights in a  dynamic protection model is typically easier to implement with an access list  scheme than with a capability list  real systems are much more limited than the general model and tend to  provide protection only for files unix is representative providing read write  and execution protection separately for the owner group and general public  for each file multics uses a ring structure in addition to file access hydra the  cambridge cap system and mach are capability systems that extend protection  to user defined software objects solaris implements the principle of least  privilege via role based access controt a form of the access matrix  language based protection provides finer grained arbitration of requests  and privileges than the operating system is able to provide for example a  single java jvm can run several threads each in a different protection class it  enforces the resource requests through sophisticated stack inspection and via  the type safety of the language   consider a computer system in which computer games can be played  by students only between p m and a m by faculty members  between p m and a m and by the computer center staff at all  times suggest a scheme for implementing this policy efficiently   the rc system among others has defined a tree of processes called  a process tree such that all the descendants of a process can be given  resources objects and access rights by their ancestors only thus a  descendant can never have the ability to do anything that its ancestors  cannot do the root of the tree is the operating system which has the  ability to do anything assume the set of access rights is represented  by an access matrix a a x y defines the access rights of process x to  object y if xis a descendant of z what is the relationship between a x y  and a z y for an arbitrary object y   how are the access matrix facility and the role based access control  facility similar how do they differ   discuss the need for rights amplification in hydra how does this  practice compare with the cross ring calls in a ring protection scheme     explain why a capability based system such as hydra provides greater  flexibility than the ring protection scheme in enforcing protection  policies   consider the ring protection scheme in multics if we were to imple\\xad ment the system calls of a typical operating system and store them in a  segment associated with ring what should be the values stored in the  ring field of the segment descriptor what happens during a system  call when a process executing in a higher numbered ring invokes a  procedure in ring   discuss the strengths and weaknesses of implementing an access matrix  using capabilities that are associated with domains   discuss the strengths and weaknesses of implementing an access matrix  using access lists that are associated with objects   the access control matrix can be used to determine whether a process  can switch from say domain a to domain b and enjoy the access  privileges of domain b is this approach equivalent to including the  access privileges of domain b in those of domain a   how can systems that implement the principle of least privilege still  have protection failures that lead to security violations   how does the principle of least privilege aid in the creation of protection  systems   what protection problems may arise if a shared stack is used for  parameter passing   if all the access rights to an object are deleted the object can no longer  be accessed at this point the object should also be deleted and the  space it occupies should be returned to the system suggest an efficient  implementation of this scheme   discuss which of the following systems allow module designers to  enforce the

a burroughs b b mcp file can be tagged as sensitive data  when such a file is deleted its storage area is overwritten by some  random bits for what purpose would such a scheme be useful  the access matrix model of protection between domains and objects was  developed by lampson and lampson  popek and saltzer  and schroeder provided excellent surveys on the subject of protection  harrison et al  used a formal version of this model to enable them to  prove properties of a protection system mathematically  the concept of a capability evolved from iliffe s and jodeit s codewords  which were implemented in the rice university computer iliffe and jodeit    the term capability was introduced by dennis and horn   the hydra system was described by wulf et al  the cap system  was described by

of  policy and mechanism was advocated by the designer of hydra levin et al    the confinement problem was first discussed by lampson and  was further examined by lipner   the use of higher level languages for specifying access control was  suggested first by morris  who proposed the use of the seal and unseal  operations discussed in section kieburtz and silberschatz  kieburtz  and silberschatz  and mcgraw and andrews proposed various  language constructs for dealing with general dynamic resource management  schemes jones and liskov considered how a static access control scheme  can be incorporated in a programming language that supports abstract data  types the use of minimal operating system support to enforce protection was  advocated by the exokernel project ganger et al  kaashoek et al    protection as we discussed in chapter is strictly an internal problem how  do we provide controlled access to programs and data stored in a computer  system on the other hand requires not only an adequate protection  system but also consideration of the external environment within which the  system operates a protection system is ineffective if user authentication is  compromised or a program is run by an unauthorized user  computer resources must be guarded against unauthorized access mali\\xad cious destruction or alteration and accidental introduction of inconsistency  these resources include information stored in the system both data and code  as well as the cpu memory disks tapes and networking that are the com\\xad puter in this chapter we start by examining ways in which resources may  be accidentally or purposely misused we then explore a key security enabler   cryptography finally we look at mechanisms to guard against or detect  attacks  to discuss security threats and attacks  to explain the fundamentals of encryption authentication and hashing  to examine the uses of cryptography in computing  to describe various countermeasures to security attacks  in many applications ensuring the security of the computer system is worth  considerable effort large commercial systems containing payroll or other  financial data are inviting targets to thieves systems that contain data pertain\\xad ing to corporate operations may be of interest to unscrupulous competitors  furthermore loss of such data whether by accident or fraud can seriously  impair the ability of the corporation to function  in chapter we discussed mechanisms that the operating system can  provide with appropriate aid from the hardware that allow users to protect     chapter  their resources including programs and data these mechanisms work well  only as long as the users conform to the intended use of and access to these  resources we say that a system is if its resources are used and accessed  as intended under all circumstances unfortunately total security cannot be  achieved nonetheless we must have mechanisms to make security breaches  a rare occurrence rather than the norm  security violations or misuse of the system can be categorized as inten\\xad tional malicious or accidental it is easier to protect against accidental misuse  than against malicious misuse for the most part protection mechanisms are  the core of protection from accidents the following list includes several forms  of accidental and malicious security violations we should note that in our  discussion of security we use the terms intruder and cracker for those attempting  to breach security in addition a is the potential for a security violation  such as the discovery of a vulnerability whereas an is the attempt to  break security  breach of confidentiality this type of violation involves mauthorized  reading of data or theft of information typically a breach of confiden\\xad tiality is the goal of an intruder capturing secret data from a system or  a data stream such as credit card information or identity information for  identity theft can result directly in money for the intruder  breach of integrity this violation involves unauthorized modification  of data such attacks can for example result in passing of liability to  an innocent party or modification of the source code of an important  commercial application  breach of availability this violation involves unauthorized destruction of  data some crackers would rather wreak havoc and gain status or bragging  rights than gain financially web site defacement is a common example of  this type of security breach  theft of service this violation involves unauthorized use of resources  for example an intruder or intrusion program may install a daemon on  a system that acts as a file server  denial of service this violation involves preventing legitimate use of the  system or attacks are sometimes accidental the  original internet worm turned into a dos attack when a bug failed to delay  its rapid spread we discuss dos attacks further in section   attackers use several standard methods in their attempts to breach  security the most common is in which one participant in  a communication pretends to be someone another host or another  person by masquerading attackers breach the correctness  of identification they can then gain access that they would not normally be  allowed or escalate their privileges obtain privileges to which they would not  normally be entitled another common attack is to replay a captured exchange  of data a consists of the malicious or fraudulent repeat of a  valid data transmission sometimes the replay comprises the entire attack  for example in a repeat of a to transfer money but frequently it is  done along with again to escalate privileges consider    normal  attacker  masquerading  attacker  man in the middle  attacker  figure standard security attacks  the damage that could be done if a request for authentication had a legitimate  user s information with an unauthorized user s yet another kind of  attack is the in which an attacker sits in the data  flow of a communication masquerading as the sender to the receiver and  vice versa in a network communication a man in the middle attack may be  preceded by a in which an active communication session is  intercepted several attack methods are depicted in figure  as we have already suggested absolute protection of the system from  malicious abuse is not possible but the cost to the perpetrator can be made  sufficiently high to deter most intruders in some cases such as a denial of\\xad service attack it is preferable to prevent the attack but sufficient to detect the  attack so that cmmtermeasures can be taken  to protect a system we must take security measures at four levels  physical the site or sites containing the computer systems must be  physically secured against armed or surreptitious entry by intruders  both the machine rooms and the terminals or workstations that have  access to the machines must be secured   chapter  must be done carefully to assure that only  access to the system even authorized users  to let others use their access in exchange  they may also be tricked into allowing  one type of social engineering attack  here a legitimate looking e mail or web page misleads  a user into entering confidential information another teclucique is human authorization  appropriate users have  however may be  for a bribe for  access via  is  a general term for attempting to gather information in  order to gain unauthorized access to the computer by looking through  trash finding phone books or finding notes containing passwords for  example these security problems are management and personnel issues  not problems pertaining to operating systems  operating system the system must protect itself from accidental or  purposeful security breaches a runaway process could constitute an  accidental denial of service attack a query to a service could reveal pass\\xad words a stack overflow could the launching of an unauthorized  process list of possible breaches is almost endless  network much computer data in modern systems travels over private  leased lines shared lines like the internet wireless connections or dial up  lines intercepting these data could be just as harmful as breaking into a  computer and interruption communications could constitute a remote  denial of service attack diminishing users use of and trust in the system  at the first two levels must be inaintained if operating system  is to be ensured a weakness at a high security physical or  allows circumvention of strict low level operating system security  measures the old adage that a chal l is as weak as its weakest link is  true of system security all these aspects must be addressed for  to be maintained  to allow the  more  is as intruders  countermeasures are created and deployed  this causes intruders to become more in their attacks for  incidents include the use of to  section  tools needed to block the  in the remainder of this    ways ranging from passwords for authentication through guarding against  viruses to detecting intrusions we start with an exploration of security threats  processes along with the kernel are the only means of accomplishing work  on a computer therefore writing a program that creates a breach of security  or causing a normal process to change its behavior and create a breach is a  common goal of crackers in fact even most nonprogram security events have  as their goal causing a program threat for example while it is useful to log in  to a without authorization it is quite a lot more useful to leave behind  a daemon that provides information or allows easy access even if  the original exploit is blocked in this section we describe common methods  which programs cause security breaches note that there is considerable  variation in the naming conventions of security holes and that we use the most  common or descriptive terms   horse  systems have mechanisms for allowing programs written by users to  be executed by other users if these programs are executed in a domain that  provides the access rights of the executing user the other users may misuse  these rights a text editor program for example may include code to search  the file to be edited for certairl keywords if any are found the entire file  may be to a special area accessible to the creator of the text editor  a code segment that misuses its environment is called a long  search paths as are common on unix systems exacerbate the trojan  horse the search path lists the set of directories to search when an  program name is given the is searched for a file of that  name and the file is executed all the directories in such a search path must  be secure or a horse could be slipped into the user s and executed  consider the use of the character in a search path the  to include the current directory in the search if a user has   in her search has set her current to a friend s directory and  enters the name of a normal system commanct be executed  from the friend s instead the program would run the user s  to do anything that the user is allowed to  the user s instance  horse is a that emulates a  what   chapter  such as the control alt delete conlbination used by all modern windows  operating systems  another variation on the trojan horse is spyware sometimes  accompanies a program that the user has chosen to install most frequently it  comes along with freeware or shareware programs but sometimes it is included  with commercial software the goal of spyware is to download ads to display  on the user s system create when certain sites are  visited or capture information from the user s system and return it to a central  site this latter is an example of a general category of attacks known as  in which surreptitious communication occurs for example  the installation of an innocuous seeming program on a windows system could  result in the loading of a spyware daemon the spyware could contact a central  site be given a message and a list of recipient addresses and deliver the spam  message to those users from the windows machine this process continues  until the user discovers the spyware frequently the spyware is not discovered  in it was estimated that percent of spam was being delivered by this  method this theft of service is not even considered a crime in most countries  spyware is a micro example of a macro problem violation of the principle  of least privilege under most circumstances a user of an operating system  does not need to install network daemons such daemons are installed via  two mistakes first a user may run with more privileges than necessary for  example as the administrator allowing programs that she runs to have more  access to the system than is necessary this is a case of human error a common  security weakness second an operating system may allow by default more  privileges than a normal user needs this is a case of poor operating system  design decisions an operating system and indeed software in general  should allow fine grained control of access and security but it must also be easy  to manage and understand inconvenient or inadequate security measures are  bound to be circumvented causing an overall weakening of the security they  were designed to implement   trap door  the designer of a program or system might leave a hole in the software that only  he is capable of using this type of security breach or was shown in  the movie war games for instance the code inight check a specific user id or  password and it might circumvent normal security procedures programmers  have been arrested for embezzling from banks by including rounding errors  in their code and having the occasional half cent credited to their accounts  this account credititrg can add up to a large amount of money considering the  number of transactions that a large bank executes  a clever trap door could be included in a compiler the compiler could  generate standard object code as well as a trap door regardless of the source  code being compiled this activity is particularly nefarious since a search of  the source code of the program will not reveal any problems only the source  code of the compiler would contain the information  trap doors pose a difficult problem because to detect them we have to  analyze all the source code for all components of a system given that software  systems may consist of millions of lines of code this analysis is not done  frequently and frequently it is not done at all     logic bomb  consider a program that initiates a security incident only under certain  circltmstances it would be hard to detect because under normal operations  there would be no security hole however when a predefined set of parameters  were met the security hole would be created this scenario is known as a  a programmer for example might write code to detect whether  was still employed if that check failed a daemon could be spawned to allow  remote access or code could be launched to cause damage to the site   stack and buffer overflow  the stack or buffer overflow attack is the most common way for an attacker  outside the system on a network or dial up connection to gain unauthorized  access to the target system an authorized user of the system may also use this  exploit for privilege escalation  essentially the attack exploits a bug in a program the bug can be a simple  case of poor programming in which the programmer neglected to code bounds  checking on an input field in this case the attacker sends more data than the  program was expecting by using trial and error or by examining the source  code of the attacked program if it is available the attacker determines the  vulnerability and writes a program to do the following  overflow an input field command line argument or input buffer for  example on a network daemon wl til it writes into the stack  overwrite the current return address on the stack with the address of the  exploit code loaded in step  write a simple set of code for the next space in the stack that includes  the commands that the attacker wishes to execute for instance spawn  a shell  the result of this attack program s execution will be a root shell or other  privileged command execution  for instance if a web page form expects a user name to be entered into a  field the attacker could send the user name plus extra characters to overflow  the buffer and reach the stack plus a new return address to load onto the stack  plus the code the attacker wants to run when the buffer reading subroutine  returns from execution the return address is the exploit code and the code  is run  let s look at a buffer overflow exploit in more detail consider the simple  c program in fig re this program creates a character array  size buffer size and copies the contents of the parameter provided on the  command line argv  as long as the size of this parameter is less than  buffer size we need one byte to store the null terminator this program  works properly but consider what happens if the parameter provided on the  command line is longer than buffer size in this scenario the strcpy  function will begin copying from argv until it encounters a null terminator   or until the program crashes thus this program suffers from a potential  problem in which copied data overflow the buffer array   chapter   include stdio h   define buffer size  int main int argc char argv     char buffer buffer size  if argc   return  else  strcpy buffer argv   return    figure c program with buffer overflow condition  note that a careful programmer could have performed bounds checking  on the size of argv by using the strncpy function rather than strcpy   replacing the line strcpy buffer argv  with strncpy buffer  argv sizeof buffer  unfortunately good bounds checking is  the exception rather than the norm  furthermore lack of bounds checking is not the only possible cause of the  behavior of the program in figure the program could instead have been  carefully designed to compromise the integrity of the system we now consider  the possible security vulnerabilities of a buffer overflow  when a function is invoked in a typical computer architecture the variables  defined locally to the function sometimes known as automatic variables the  parameters passed to the function and the address to which control returns  once the function exits are stored in a stack frame the layout for a typical stack  frame is shown in figure examining the stack frame from top to bottom  we first see the parameters passed to the function followed by any automatic  variables declared in the function we next see the frame pointer which is  the address of the beginning of the stack frame finally we have the return  bottom frame pointer  grows  top  figure the layout for a typical stack frame    address which specifies where to return control once the function exits the  frame pointer must be saved on the stack as the value of the stack pointer can  vary during the function call the saved frame pointer allows relative access to  parameters and automatic variables  given this standard memory layout a cracker could execute a buffer\\xad overflow attack i ter goal is to replace the return address in the stack frame so  that it now points to the code segment containing the attacking program  the programmer first writes a short code segment such as the following   include stdio h  int main int argc char argv    execvp  bin sh  bin sh null  return  using the execvp system call this code segment creates a shell process  if the program being attacked runs with system wide permissions this newly  created shell will gain complete access to the system of course the code  segment could do anything allowed by the privileges of the attacked process  this code segment is then compiled so that the assembly language instructions  can be modified the primary modification is to remove unnecessary features  in the code thereby reducing the code size so that it can fit into a stack frame  this assembled code fragment is now a binary sequence that will be at the  heart of the attack  refer again to the program shown in figure let s assume that when  the main function is called in that program the stack frame appears as  shown in figure a using a debugger the programmer then finds the  copied   a b  figure hypothetical stack frame for figure  a before and b after   chapter  address of buffer in the stack that address is the location of the code the  attacker wants executed the binary sequence is appended with the necessary  amount of no op instructions for no operation to fill the stack frame up  to the location of the return address and the location of buffer  the new  return address is added the attack is complete when the attacker gives this  constructed binary sequence as input to the process the process then copies  the binary sequence from argv to position buffer in the stack frame  now when control returns from main  instead of returning to the location  specified by the old value of the return address we return to the modified shell  code which runs with the access rights of the attacked process figure b  contains the modified shell code  there are many ways to exploit potential buffer overflow problems in  this example we considered the possibility that the program being attacked\\xad the code shown in figure ran with system wide permissions however  the code segment that runs once the value of the return address has been  modified might perform any type of malicious act such as deleting files  opening network ports for further exploitation and so on  this example buffer overflow attack reveals that considerable knowledge  and programming skill are needed to recognize exploitable code and then  to exploit it unfortunately it does not take great programmers to launch  security attacks rather one cracker can determine the bug and then write an  exploit anyone with rudimentary computer skills and access to the exploit  a so called then try to launch the attack at target systems  the buffer overflow attack is especially pernicious because it can be run  between systems and can travel over allowed communication channels such  attacks can occur within protocols that are expected to be used to communicate  with the target machine and they can therefore be hard to detect and prevent  they can even bypass the security added by firewalls section   one solution to this problem is for the cpu to have a feature that disallows  execution of code in a stack section of memory recent versions of sun s sparc  chip include this setting and recent versions of solaris enable it the return  address of the overflowed routine can still be modified but when the return  address is within the stack and the code there attempts to execute an exception  is generated and the program is halted with an error  recent versions of amd and intel x chips include the nx feature to prevent  this type of attack the use of the feature is supported in several x operating  systems including linux and windows xp sp the hardware implementation  involves the use of a new bit in the page tables of the cpus this bit marks  the associated page as nonexecutable so that instructions cannot be read from  it and executed as this feature becomes prevalent buffer overflow attacks  should greatly diminish   viruses  another form of program threat is a a virus is a fragment of code embed\\xad ded in a legitimate program viruses are self replicating and are designed to   infect other programs they can wreak havoc in a system by modifying or  destroying files and causing system crashes and program malfunctions as  with most penetration attacks viruses are very specific to architectures oper\\xad ating systems and applications viruses are a particular problem for users of    pcs unix and other multiuser operating systems generally are not susceptible  to viruses because the executable programs are protected from writing by the  operating system even if a virus does infect such a progran its powers usually  are limited because other aspects of the system are protected  viruses are usually borne via e mail with spam the most comrnon vector  they can also spread when users download viral programs internet  file sharing services or exchange infected disks  another common form of virus transmission uses microsoft office files  such as microsoft word documents these documents can contain macros  visual basic programs that programs in the office suite powerpoint  and excel will execute automatically because these programs run under the  user s own account the macros can run largely unconstrained for example  deleting user files at will commonly the virus will also e mail itself to others  in the user s contact list here is a code sample that shows the simplicity of  writing a visual basic macro that a virus could use to format the hard drive of  a windows computer as soon as the file containing the macro was opened  sub autoopen  dim ofs  set ofs createobject scripting filesystemobject  vs shell c command com k format c  vbhide  end sub  how do viruses work once a virus reaches a target machine a program  known as a inserts the virus into the system the virus dropper  is usually a trojan horse executed for other reasons but installing the virus  as its core activity once installed the virus may do any one of a number of  things there are literally thousands of viruses but they fall into several main  categories note that many viruses belong to more than one category  file a standard file virus infects a system by appending itself to a file  it changes the start of the program so that execution jumps to its code  after it executes it returns control to the program so that its execution is  not noticed file viruses are sometimes known as parasitic viruses as they  leave no full files behind and leave the host program still functional  boot a boot virus infects the boot sector of the system executing every  time the system is booted and before the operating system is loaded it  watches for other boatable media that is floppy disks and infects them  these viruses are also known as memory viruses because they do not  appear in the file system figure shows how a boot virus works  macro most viruses are written in a low levellanguage such as assembly  or c macro viruses are written in a high level language such as visual  basic these viruses are triggered when a program capable of executing  the macro is run for example a macro virus could be contained in a  spreadsheet file  source code a source code virus looks for source code and modifies it to  include the virus and to help spread the virus   chapter  figure i a boot sector computer virus  polymorphic a polymorphic virus changes each time it is installed to  avoid detection by antivirus software the changes do not affect the virus s  functionality but rather change the virus s signature a  a pattern that cili i be used to identify a virus typically a series  make up the virus code  encrypted an encrypted virus includes decryption code along with the  encrypted virus again to avoid detection the virus first decrypts and then  executes  stealth this tricky virus attempts to avoid detection by modifying parts  of the system that could be used to detect it for example it could modify  the read system call so that if the file it has modified is read the original  form of the code is returned rather than the infected code  tunneling this virus attempts to bypass detection by an anti virus scanner  by installing itself in the interrupt handler chain similar viruses install  themselves in device drivers     multipartite a virus of this type is able to infect nmltiple parts of a system  including boot sectors memory and files this makes it difficult to detect  and contain  armored an armored virus is coded to ncake it hard for antivirus  researchers to unravel and understand it can also be compressed to avoid  detection and disinfection in addition virus droppers and other full files  that are part of a virus infestation are frequently hidden via file attributes  or unviewable file names  this vast variety of viruses is likely to continue to grow in fact in  a new and widespread virus was detected it exploited three separate bugs  for its operation this virus started by infecting hundreds of windows servers   including many trusted sites running microsoft internet information server   iis any vulnerable microsoft explorer web browser visiting those sites  received a browser virus with any download the browser virus installed  several back door programs including a which records  all things entered on the keyboard including and credit card  numbers it also installed a daemon to allow unlimited remote access by  an intruder and another that allowed an intruder to route spam through the  infected desktop computer  generally viruses are the most disruptive security attacks and because  they are effective they will continue to be written and to spread the  active debates within the computing community is whether a jth yhcn  in which many systems run the same hardware operating system and or  application software is increasing the threat of and damage caused by security  intrusions this monoculture supposedly consists of microsoft products and  part of the debate concerns whether such a monoculture even exists today  program threats typically use a breakdown in the protection mechanisms of a  system to attack programs in contrast system and network threats involve the  abuse of services and network comcections system and network threats create  a situation in which operating system resources and user files are inisused  sometimes a system and network attack is used to launch a program attack  and vice versa  the more an operating system is the more services it has enabled  and the more functions it allows the more likely it is that a is available  to exploit increasingly operating systems strive to be  for example solaris moved from a model in which many services ftp  telnet and others were enabled by default when the system was installed  to a model in which almost all services are disabled at installation time and  must specifically be enabled system administrators such changes reduce  the system s set of ways in which an attacker can to  break into the system  in the remainder of this section we discuss some examples of system  and network threats including worms port scamcing and denial of service  attacks it is important to note that masquerading and replay attacks are also   chapter  commonly launched over netvvorks between systems in fact these attacks  are more effective and harder to counter when multiple systems are involved  for example within a computer the operating system usually can determine  the sender and receiver of a message even if the sender changes to the id of  someone else there may be a record of that id change when multiple systems  are involved especially systems controlled by attackers then such tracing is  much more difficult  in general we can say that sharing secrets to prove identity and as keys to  encryption is required for authentication and encryption and sharing secrets  is easier in environments such as a single operating system in which secure  sharing methods exist these methods include shared memory and interpro\\xad cess comnmnications creating secure communication and authentication is  discussed in sections and   worms  a is a process that uses the mechanism to ravage system  performance the worm spawns copies of itself using up system resources  and perhaps locking out all other processes on computer networks worms  are particularly potent since they may reproduce themselves among systems  and thus shut down an entire network such an event occurred in to unix  systems on the internet causing the loss of system and system administrator  time worth millions of dollars  at the close of the workday on november  robert tappan morris  jr a first year cornell graduate student unleashed a worm program on one  or more hosts corm ected to the internet targeting sun microsystems sun  workstations and vax computers running variants of version bsd unix the  worm quickly spread over great distances within a few hours of its release  it had consumed system resources to the point of bringing down the infected  machines  although robert morris designed the self replicating program for rapid  reproduction and distribution some of the features of the unix networking  environment provided the means to propagate the worm throughout the sys\\xad tem it is likely that morris chose for in itial infection an internet host left open  for and accessible to outside users from there the worm program exploited  flaws in the unix operating system s security routines and took advantage  of unix utilities that simplify resource sharing in local area networks to gain  unauthorized access to thousands of other connected sites morris s methods  of attack are outlined next  the worm was made up of two programs a also called a  or program and the main program ll c the grappling  hook consisted of lines of c code compiled and run on each machine it  accessed once established on the computer system under attack the grappling  hook connected to the machine where it originated and uploaded a copy of the  main worm onto the hooked system figure  the main program proceeded  to search for other machines to which the newly infected system could connect  easily in these actions morris exploited the unix networking utility rsh for  easy remote task execution by setting up special files that list host login  name pairs users can omit entering a password each time they access a remote  account on the paired list the worm searched these special files for site names    rsh attack  finger attack  sendmail attack  worm sent  target system infected system  figure the morris internet worm  that would allow remote execution without a password where remote shells  were established the worm program was uploaded and began executing anew  the attack via remote access was one of three infection methods built into  the worm the other two methods involved operating system bugs in the unix  finger and sendmail programs  the finger utility functions as an electronic telephone directory the  command  finger user name©hostname  returns a person s real and login names along with other information that  the user may have provided such as office and home address and telephone  number research plan or clever quotation finger runs as a background  process or daemon at each bsd site and responds to queries throughout the  internet the worm executed a buffer overflow attack on finger the program  queried finger with a byte string crafted to exceed the buffer allocated  for input and to overwrite the stack frame instead of returning to the main  routine where it resided before morris s calt the finger daemon was routed  to a procedure within the invading byte string now residing on the stack  the new procedure executed bin sh which if successful gave the worm a  remote shell on the machine under attack  the bug exploited in sendmail also involved using a daemon process  for malicious entry sendmail sends receives and routes electronic mail  debugging code in the utility permits testers to verify and display the state of  the ncail system the debugging option was useful to system administrators  and was often left on morris included in his attack arsenal a call to debug that   instead of specifying a user address as would be normal in testing issued  a set of cornmands that mailed and executed a copy of the grappling hook  program  once in place the main worm systematically attempted to discover user  passwords it began by trying simple cases of no password or passwords  constructed of account user name combinations then used comparisons with  an internal dictionary of favorite password choices and then went to the   chapter  final stage of trying each word in the standard unix on line dictionary as a  possible password this elaborate and efficient three stage password cracking  algorithm enabled the worm to gain access to other user accounts on the  infected system the wontt then searched for rsh data files in these newly  broken accounts and used them as described previously to gain access to user  accounts on remote systems  with each new access the worm program searched for already active  copies of itself if it found one the new copy exited except in every seventh  instance had the worm exited on all duplicate sightings it might have  remained undetected allowing every seventh duplicate to proceed possibly  to confound efforts to stop its spread baiting with fake worms created a  wholesale infestation of sun and vax systems on the internet  the very features of the unix network environment that assisted il l the  worm s propagation also helped to stop its advance ease of electronic commu\\xad nication mechanisms to copy source and binary files to remote machines and  access to both source code and human expertise allowed cooperative efforts to  develop solutions quickly by the evening of the next day november methods  of halting the invading program were circulated to system administrators via  the internet within days specific software patches for the exploited security  flaws were available  why did morris unleash the worm the action has been characterized  as both a harmless prank gone awry and a serious criminal offense based  on the complexity of the attack it is unlikely that the worm s release or the  scope of its spread was unintentional the worm program took elaborate steps  to cover its tracks and to repel efforts to stop its spread yet the program  contained no code aimed at damaging or destroying the systems on which it  ran the author clearly had the expertise to include such commands in fact  data structures were present in the bootstrap code that could have been used to  transfer trojan horse or virus programs the behavior of the program may lead  to interesting observations but it does not provide a sound basis for inferring  motive what is not open to speculation however is the legal outcome a  federal court convicted morris and handed down a sentence of three years  probation hours of community service and a fine morris s legal  costs probably exceeded   security experts continue to evaluate methods to decrease or eliminate  worms a more recent event though shows that worms are still a fact of  life on the internet it also shows that as the internet grows the damage  that even harmless worms can do also grows and can be significant this  example occurred during august the fifth version of the sobig worm  more properly known as w sobig f mm was released by persons at this  time unknown it was the fastest spreading worm released to date at its peak  mfecting hundreds of thousands of computers and one in seventeen e mail  messages on the internet it clogged e mail inboxes slowed networks and  took a huge number of hours to clean up  sobig f was launched by being uploaded to a pornography newsgroup via  an account created with a stolen credit card it was disguised as a photo the  virus targeted microsoft windows systems and used its own smtp engine to  e mail itself to all the addresses found on an infected system it used a variety  of subject lines to help avoid detection including thank you your details  and re approved it also used a random address on the host as the from    address making it difficult to determine from the message which machine was  the infected source sobig f included an attachment for the target e mail reader  to click on again with a variety of names if this payload was executed it stored  a program called winppr exe in the default windows directory along with  a text file it also modified the windows registry  the code included in the attachment was also programmed to periodically  attempt to connect to one of twenty servers and download and execute a  program from them fortunately the servers were disabled before the code  could be downloaded the content of the program from these servers has not  yet been determined if the code was malevolent untold damage to a vast  number of machines could have resulted   port scanning  port scanning is not an attack but rather a means for a cracker to detect  a system s vulnerabilities to attack port scanning typically is automated  involving a tool that attempts to create a tcp lip connection to a specific port  or a range of ports for example suppose there is a known vulnerability or  bug in sendmail a cracker could launch a port scanner to try to connect say  to port of a particular system or to a range of systems if the connection  was successful the cracker or tool could attempt to communicate with the  answering service to determine if the service was indeed sendmail and if so  if it was the version with the bug  now imagine a tool in which each bug of every service of every operath g  system was encoded the tool could attempt to connect to every port of one  or nwre systems for every service that answered it could try to use each  known bug frequently the bugs are buffer overflows allowing the creation of  a privileged command shell on the system from there of course the cracker  could install trojan horses back door programs and so on  there is no such tool but there are tools that perform subsets of that  functionality for example nmap from http www insecure org mrtap is  a very versatile open source utility for network exploration and security  auditing when pointed at a target it will determine what services are n n tling  including application names and versions it can identify the host operating  system it can also provide information about defenses such as what firewalls  are defending the target it does not exploit any known bugs  nessus from http www nessus org performs a similar function but  it has a database of bugs and their exploits it can scan a range of systems  determine the services running on those systems and attempt to attack all  appropriate bugs it generates reports about the results it does not perform  the final step of exploiting the found bugs but a knowledgeable cracker or a  script kiddie could  because port scans are detectable section  they frequently are  launched from such systems are previously compromised  independent systems that are serving their owners while being used for nefar\\xad ious purposes including denial of service attacks and spam relay zombies  make crackers particularly difficult to prosecute because determining the  source of the attack and the person that launched it is challenging this is  one of many reasons for securing inconsequential systems not just systems  containing valuable information or services   chapter   denial of service  as mentioned earlier denial of service attacks are aimed not at gaming  information or stealing resources but rather at disrupting legitimate use of  a system or facility most such attacks involve systems that the attacker has  not penetrated indeed launching an attack that prevents legitimate use is  frequently easier than breaking into a machine or facility  denial of service attacks are generally network based they fall into two  categories attacks in the first category use so many facility resources that  in essence no useful work can be done for example a web site click could  download a java applet that proceeds to use all available cpu time or to pop up  windows infinitely the second category involves disrupting the network of  the facility there have been several successful denial of service attacks of this  kind against major web sites these attacks result from abuse of some of the  fundamental functionality of tcp lip for instance if the attacker sends the part  of the protocol that says i want to start a tcp connection but never follows  with the standard the connection is now complete the result can be partially  started tcp sessions if enough of these sessions are launched they can eat up  all the network resources of the system disabling any further legitimate tcp  connections such attacks which can last hours or days have caused partial or  full failure of attempts to use the target facility the attacks are usually stopped  at the network level until the operating systems can be updated to reduce their  vulnerability  generally it is impossible to prevent denial of service attacks the attacks  use the same mechanisms as normal even more difficult to prevent  and resolve are these attacks  are launched from multiple sites at once toward a common target typically  by zombies ddos attacks have become more comncon and are sometimes  associated with blackmail attempts a site comes under attack and the  attackers offer to halt the attack in exchange for money  sometimes a site does not even know it is under attack it can be difficult  to determine whether a system slowdown is an attack or just a surge in system  use consider that a successful advertising campaign that greatly increases  traffic to a site could be considered a ddos  there are other interesting aspects of dos attacks for example if an  authentication algorithm locks an account for a period of time after several  incorrect attempts to access the account then an attacker could cause all  authentication to be blocked by purposely making incorrect attempts to access  all accounts similarly a firewall that automatically blocks certain kinds of  traffic could be induced to block that traffic when it should not these examples  suggest that programmers and systems managers need to fully understand the  algorithms and technologies they are deploying finally computer science  classes are notorious sources of accidental system dos attacks consider the  first programming exercises in which students learn to create subprocesses  or threads a common bug involves spawning subprocesses infinitely the  system s free memory and cpu resources don t stand a chance  there are many defenses against computer attacks running the gamut from  methodology to technology the broadest tool available to system designers    and users is cryptography in this section we discuss the details of cryptogra\\xad phy and its use in computer security  in an isolated computer the operating system can reliably determine the  sender and recipient of ali interprocess communication since it controls all  communication channels in the computer in a network of computers the  situation is quite different a networked computer receives bits from the  wire with no immediate and reliable way of determining what machine or  application sent those bits similarly the computer sends bits onto the network  with no of knowing who might eventually receive them  commonly network addresses are used to infer the potential senders  and receivers of network messages network packets arrive with a source  address such as an ip address and when a computer sends a message it  names the intended receiver by specifying a destination address however for  applications where security matters we are asking for trouble if we assume  that the source or destination address of a packet reliably determines who sent  or received that packet a rogue computer can send a message with a falsified  source address and numerous computers other than the one specified by the  destination address can and typically do receive a packet for example all of  the routers on the way to the destination will receive the packet too how then  is an operating system to decide whether to grant a request when it cannot trust  the named source of the request and how is it supposed to provide protection  for a request or data when it cannot determine who will receive the response  or message contents it sends over the network  it is generally considered infeasible to build a network of any scale in  which the source and destination addresses of packets can be trusted in this  sense therefore the only alternative is somehow to eliminate the need to  trust the network this is the job of cryptography abstractly   ro rnron  used to constrain the potential senders and or receivers of a message  cryptography is based on secrets called that are selectively distributed to  computers in a network and used to process messages cryptography enables a  recipient of a message to verify that the message was created by some computer  possessing a certain key the key is the source of the message similarly a  sender can encode its message so that only a computer with a certain key can  decode the message so that the key becomes the destination unlike network  addresses however keys are designed so that it is not computationally feasible  to derive them from the messages they were used to generate or from any  other public information thus they provide a much more trustworthy means  of constraining senders and receivers of messages note that cryptography is  a field of study unto itself with large and small complexities and subtleties  here we explore the most important aspects of the parts of cryptography that  pertain to operating systems   encryption  because it solves a wide variety of communication security problems  is used frequently in many aspects of modern computing encryption  a means for constraining the possible receivers of a message an encryption  algorithm enables the sender of a message to ensure that only a computer  possessing a certain key can read the message encryption of messages is an  ancient practice of course and there have been many encryption algorithms   chapter  dating back to ancient times in this section we describe important modern  encryption principles and algorithms  figure shows an example of two users communicating securely over  an insecure channel we refer to this figure throughout the section note that the  key exchange can take place directly between the two parties or via a trusted  third party that is a certificate authority as discussed in section   an encryption algorithm consists of the following components  a set k of keys  a set m of messages  a set c of ciphertexts  a function e k  m  c thatis for each k e k e k is a function for  generating ciphertexts from messages both e and e lc for any k should  be efficiently computable functions  a function d i  c  m thatis for eachlc e i d k is a function for  generating messages from ciphertexts both d and d lc for any k should  be efficiently computable functions  an encryption algorithm must provide this essential property given a cipher\\xad text c e c a computer can compute m such that e lc m c only if it possesses  write  rnessage rn  i  ii    z x    read message ml  figure i a secure communication over an insecure medium    d lc thus a computer holding d lc can decrypt ciphertexts to the plaintexts  used to produce them but a computer not holding d lc cannot decrypt cipher\\xad texts since ciphertexts are generally exposed for example sent on a network  it is important that it be infeasible to derive d lc from the ciphertexts  there are two main types of encryption algorithms symmetric and  asymmetric we discuss both types in the following sections   symmetric encryption  in a the same key is used to encrypt and to  decrypt that is e can be from d lc and vice versa therefore the  secrecy of e lc must be protected to the same extent as that of d lc  for the past several decades the most commonly used symmetric encryp\\xad tion algorithm in the united states for civilian applications has been the  adopted by the national institute of stan\\xad techxwlogy nist des works by taking a bit value and a bit  key and performing a series of transformations these transformations are  based on substitution and permutation operations as is generally the case  for symmetric encryption transformations some of the transformations are  in that their algorithms are hidden in fact these  so called s boxes are classified by the united states government messages  longer than bits are broken into bit chunks because des works on a  chunk of bits at a time is known as a cipher if the same key is used  for encrypting an extended anwunt of data it becomes vulnerable to attack  consider for example that the same source block would result in the same  ciphertext if the same key and encryption algorithm were used therefore  the chunks are not just encrypted but also exclusive or ed xored with the  ciphertext block before encryption this is known as  des is now considered insecure for many applications because its keys can  be exhaustively searched with moderate computing resources rather than  giving up on des though nist created a modification called in  which the des algorithm is repeated three times two encryptions and one  decryption on the same plaintext usli lg two or three keys for example  c e k d lc e k m  when three keys are used the effective key length  is bits triple des is in widespread use today  in nist a new encryption algorithm called the  to replace des aes is another symmetric block  cipher it can use key lengths of  and bits and works on bit  blocks it works by performing to rounds of transformations on a matrix  formed from a block generally the algorithm is compact and efficient  several other symmetric block encryption algorithms in use today bear  mentioning the algorithm is fast compact and easy to implement it  can use a variable key length of up to bits and works on bit blocks  can vary in key length number of transformations and block size because it  uses only basic computational operations it can run on a wide variety of crus  is perhaps the most common stream cipher a is  designed to encrypt and decrypt a stream of bytes or bits rather than a block  this is useful when the length of a communication would make a block cipher  too slow the key is input into a pseudo random bit generator which is an   chapter  algorithm that attempts to produce random bits the output of the generator  when fed a key is a keystream a is an infinite set of keys that can be  used for the input plaintext stream rc is used in encrypting steams of data  such as in wep the wireless lan protocol lt is also used in communications  between web browsers and web servers as we discuss below unfortunately  rc as used in wep ieee standard has been found to be breakable in a  reasonable amount of con puter time in fact rc itself has vulnerabilities   asymmetric encryption  in an there are different encryption and  decryption keys here we one such algorithm known as rsa after  the names of its inventors rivest shamir and adleman the rsa cipher is a  block cipher public key algorithm and is the most widely used asymmetrical  algorithm asymmetrical algorithms based on elliptical curves are gaining  ground however because the key length of such an algorithm can be shorter  for the same amount of cryptographic strength  it is computationally infeasible to derive d kd n from e lee n and so  e ke n need not be kept secret and can be widely disseminated thus e lee n   or just ice is the and d kd n or just led is the n is the  figure encryption and decryption using rsa asymmetric cryptography    product of two large randomly chosen prime numbers p and q for example p  andq arebitseach theencryptionalgorithmis e kc n rn mk mod n  where icc satisfies leekd mod p q  the decryption algorithm is then  d kd n c ckd mod n  an example using small values is shown in figure in this example we  make p and q  we then calculate n  and p q   we next select kc relatively prime to and  yielding finally we calculate  kd such that kekrt mod  yielding we now have our keys the public  key lee n  and the private key led n  encrypting the message   with the public key results in the message which is then decoded by the  receiver via the private key  the use of asymmetric encryption begins with the publication of the public  key of the destination for bidirectional communication the source also must  publish its public key publication can be as simple as handing over an  electronic copy of the key or it can be more complex the private key or secret  key must be jealously guarded as anyone holding that key can decrypt any  message created by the matching public key  we should note that the seemingly small difference in key use between  asymmetric and symmetric cryptography is quite large in practice asymmetric  cryptography is based on mathematical functions rather than transformations  inaking it much more computationally expensive to execute it is much  faster for a computer to encode and decode ciphertext by using the usual  symmetric algorithms than by using asymmetric algorithms why then use  an asymmetric algorithm in truth these algorithms are not used for general\\xad purpose encryption of large amounts of data however they are used not  only for encryption of small amounts of data but also for authentication  confidentiality and key distribution as we show in the following sections   authentication  we have seen that encryption offers a way of constraining the set of possible  receivers of a message constraining the set of potential senders of a message is  called authentication is thus complementary to encryption in  fact sometimes their functions overlap consider that an encrypted message  can also prove the identity of the sender for example if d kd n e ke n m  produces a valid message then we know that the creator of the message must  hold ke authentication is also useful for proving that a message has not been  modified in this section we discuss authentication as a constraint on possible  receivers of a message note that this sort of authentication is similar to but  distinct from user authentication which we discuss in section  an authentication algorithm consists of the following components  a set k of keys  a set m of messages  a set a of authenticators  a functions k  m a that is for each k e k s k is a function for  generating authenticators from messages both sand s k for any k should  be efficiently computable functions   chapter  a function v   m x a true false that is for each lc e k  v lc is a function for verifying authenticators on messages both v and  v lc for any lc should be efficiently computable functions  the critical property that an authentication algorithm must possess is this for a  message m a computer can generate an authenticator a e a such that v lc m a   true only if it possesses s lc thus a computer holding s lc can generate  authenticators on messages so that any computer possessing v lc can verify  them however a computer not holding s lc cannot generate authenticators  on messages that can be verified using v lc since authenticators are generally  exposed for example sent on a network with the messages themselves it  must not be feasible to derive s lc from the authenticators  just as there are two types of encryption algorithms there are two main  varieties of authentication algorithms the first in understanding these  algorithms is to explore hash functions a h m creates a small  fixed sized block of data known as a or from  a message m hash functions work by taking a message in n bit blocks and  processing the blocks to produce an n bit hash h must be collision resistant  on m that is it must be infeasible to find an m such that h m h n  now if h m h m we know that m m that is we know that the  message has not been modified common message digest functions include  which produces a bit hash and which outputs a bit hash  message digests are useful for detecting changed messages but are not useful as  authenticators for example h m can be sent along with a message but if his  known then someone could modify m and recompute h m and the message  modification would not be detected therefore an authentication algorithm  takes the message digest and encrypts it  the first main type of authentication algorithm uses symmetric encryption  in a a cryptographic checksum is gener  ated from message using a secret key knowledge of v lc and knowledge  of s lc are equivalent one can be derived from the other so lc must be kept  secret a simple example of a mac defines s lc m f k h m where f is  a function that is one way on its first argument that is k camt be derived  from f k h m  because of the collision resistance in the hash function we  are reasonably assured that no other message could create the same mac a  suitable verification algorithm is then v lc m a  j lc m a note that k  is needed to compute both s lc and v lc so anyone able to compute one can  compute the other  the second main type of authentication algorithm is a  and the authenticators thus produced are called  in a digital signature algorithm it is computationally to derive s ks  from v lcv in particular vis a one way function thus kv is the public key  and lc is the private key  consider as an example the rsa digital signature algorithm it is similar  to the rsa encryption algorithm but the key use is reversed the digital  signature of a message is derived by computing s lcs m h m s mod n  the key c again is a pair d n where n is the product of two large randomly  chosen prime numbers p and q the verification algorithm is then v kv m a   ak mod n h m where kv satisfies lc c mod p q     lf encryption can prove the identity of the sender of a m essage then why do  we need separate authentication algorithms there are three primary reasons  authentication algorithms generally require fewer computations with  the notable exception of h sa digital signatures over large amounts of  plaintext this efficiency can make a huge difference in resource use and  the time needed to authenticate a message  the authenticator of a message is almost always shorter than the mes\\xad sage and its ciphertext this improves space use and transmission time  efficiency  sometimes we want authentication but not confidentiality for example  a company could provide a software patch and could sign that patch to  prove that it came from the company and that it hasn t been modified  authentication is a component of many aspects of security for example it  is the core of which supplies proof that an entity performed an  action a typical example of nonrepudiation involves the filling out of electronic  forms as an alternative to the signing of paper contracts nonrepudiation  assures that a person filling out an electronic form cannot deny that he did  so   key distribution  certainly a good part of the battle between cryptographers those inventing  ciphers and cryptanalysts those trying to break them involves keys with  symmetric algorithms both parties need the key and no one else should  have it the delivery of the symmetric key is a huge challenge sometimes  it is performed cut or band say via a paper document or a conversation  these methods do not scale well however also consider the key management  challenge suppose a user wanted to communicate with n other users privately  that user would need n keys and for more security would need to change  those keys frequently  these are the very reasons for efforts to create asymmetric key algorithms  not only can the keys be exchanged in public but a given user needs only  one private key no matter how many other people she wants to communicate  with there is still the matter of managing a public key for each party to be  communicated with but since public keys need not be secured simple storage  can be used for that  unfortunately even the distribution of public keys requires some care  consider the man in the middle attack shown in figure here the person  who wants to receive an encrypted message sends out his public key but an  attacker also sends her bad public key which matches her private key the  person who wants to send the encrypted message knows no better and so uses  the bad key to encrypt the message the attacker then happily decrypts it  the problem is one of authentication what we need is proof of who or  what owns a public one to solve that problem involves the use  of digital certificates a is a public key digitally signed by a  trusted party the trusted party receives proof of identification from some entity   chapter  encryption   key kbad  attacker  decryption  key kd   co u c   aq  cd decryption   key kbad     read message m i  figure a man in the middle attack on asymmetric cryptography  and certifies that the public key  we can trust the certifier these have their public keys  i j l cluded within web browsers and other consumers of certificates before they  are distributed the certificate authorities can then vouch for other authorities   digitally signing the public keys of these other authorities and so on creating  a web of trust the certificates can be distributed in a standard x digital  certificate format that can be parsed by computer this scheme is used for  secure web communication as we discuss in section    implementation of cryptography  network protocols are typically organized in each layer acting as a client  of the one below it that is when one protocol generates a message to send  to its protocol peer on another machine it hands its message to the protocol  below it in the network protocol stack for delivery to its peer on that machine  for example in an ip network tcp a transport layer protocol acts as a client  of ip a network layer protocol tcp packets are passed down to ip for delivery  to the tcp peer at the other end of the tcp connection ip encapsulates the tcp    packet in an ip packet which it similarly passes down to the data link layer to be  transmitted across the network to its ip peer on the destination computer this  ip peer then delivers the tcp up to the tcp peer on that machine all in  all the which has been almost universally adopted as a  model for data networking defines seven such protocol layers you will read  more about the iso model of networking in chapter figure shows a  diagram of the model  cryptography can be inserted at almost any layer in the iso model ssl   section  for example provides security at the transport layer network\\xad layer security generally has been standardized on which defines ip  packet formats that allow the insertion of authenticators and the encryption  of packet contents it uses symmetric encryption and uses the protocol  for key ipsec is becoming widely used as the basis for  in which all traffic between two ipsec endpoints  is encrypted to make a private network out of one that may otherwise be  public numerous protocols also have been developed for use by applications  but then the applications themselves must be coded to implement security  where is cryptographic protection best placed in a protocol stack in  general there is no definitive answer on the one hand more protocols benefit  from protections placed lower in the stack for example since ip packets  encapsulate tcp packets encryption of ip packets using ipsec for example also  hides the contents of the encapsulated tcp packets similarly authenticators  on ip packets detect the modification of contaii ed tcp header information  on the other hand protection at lower layers in the protocol stack may give  insufficient protection to higher layer protocols for example an application  server that runs over ipsec might be able to authenticate the client computers  from which requests are received however to authenticate a user at a client  computer the server may need to use an application level protocol for  example the user may be required to type a password also consider the  problem of e mail e mail delivered via the industry standard smtp protocol is  stored and forwarded frequently multiple times before it is delivered each of  these transmissions could go over a secure or an insecure network for e mail  to be secure the e mail message needs to be encrypted so that its security is  independent of the transports that carry it   an example ssl  ssl is a cryptographic protocol that enables two computers to corrumjjicate  securely that is so that each can limit the sender and receiver of  to the other it is perhaps the most commonly used cryptographic  on the internet today since it is the standard protocol by which web  communicate securely with web servers for completeness we should note that  ssl was designed by netscape and that it evolved into the industry standard  tls protocol in this discussion we use ssl to mean both ssl and tls  ssl is a complex protocol with many options here we present only a  single variation of it and even then in a very simplified and abstract form  so as to maintain focus on its use of cryptographic primitives what we are  about to see is a complex dance in which asymmetric cryptography is used so  that a client and a server can establish a secure cey that can be used  for symmetric encryption of the session between the two all of this while   chapter  avoiding man in the middle and replay attacks for added cryptographic  strength the session keys are forgotten once a session is completed another  communication between the two will generation of new session keys  the ssl protocol is initiated by a c to communicate securely with a  prior to the protocol s use the server s is assumed to have obtained  a certificate denoted cert from certification authority ca this certificate is a  structure containing the following  various attributes attrs of the server such as its unique distinguished name  and its common dns name  the identity of a public encryption algorithm e for the server  the public key kc of this server  a validity interval interval durirtg which the certificate should be consid\\xad ered valid  a digital signature a on the above information made by theca that is  a s kca attrs e ke interval  in addition prior to the protocol s use the client is presumed to have obtained  the public verification algorithm v kca for ca in the case of the web the user s  browser is shipped from its vendor containing the verification algorithms and  public keys of certain certification authorities the user can add or delete these  for certification authorities as she chooses  this protocol enables the server to limit the recipients of its messages to the  client that generated pms and to limit the senders of the messages it accepts  to that same client similarly the client can limit the recipients of the messages  it sends and the senders of the messages it accepts to the party that knows  s kd that is the party that can decrypt cpms in many applications such  as web transactions the client needs to verify the identity of the party that  knows s lcd this is one purpose of the certificate cert in particular the attrs  field contains information that the client can use to determine the identity\\xad for example the domain name of the server with which it is communicating  for applications in which the server also needs information about the client  ssl supports an option by which a client can send a certificate to the server  in addition to its use on the internet ssl is being used for a wide variety  of tasks for example ipsec vpns now have a competitor in ssl vpns ipsec  is good for point to point encryption of traffic say between two company  offices ssl vpns are more flexible but not as efficient so they might be used  between an individual employee working remotely and the corporate office  our earlier discussion of authentication involves messages and sessions but  what about users if a system cannot authenticate a user then authenticating  that a message can le from that user is thus a major security problem  for operating systems is the protection system depends  on the ability to identify the programs and processes currently executing  which in turn depends on the ability to identify each user the system users  identify themselves how do we determine a user s  is authentic generally user authentication is based on one or more  things the user s possession of something a or card the user s  of something user identifier and password an attribute  retina or signature   passwords  the most comm on  when the user a user is the use of  user id or account name she   chapter  is asked for a password i£ the user supplied password matches the password  stored in the system the system assumes that the account is being accessed by  the owner of that account  passwords are often used to protect objects in the computer system in  the absence of more complete protection schemes they can be considered a  special case of either keys or capabilities for instance a password may be  associated with each resource such as a file whenever a request is made to  use the resource the password nmst be given if the password is correct access  is granted different passwords may be associated with different access rights  for example different passwords may be used for reading files appending  files and updating files  in practice most systems require only one password for a user to gain  full rights although more passwords theoretically would be more secure  such systems tend not to be implemented due to the classic trade off between  security and convenience if security makes something inconvenient then the  security is frequently bypassed or otherwise circumvented   password vulnerabilities  passwords are extremely common because they are easy to understand and use  unfortunately passwords can often be guessed accidentally exposed sniffed  or illegally transferred from an authorized user to an unauthorized one as we  show next  there are two common ways to guess a password one way is for the  intruder either human or program to know the user or to have information  about the user all too frequently people use obvious information such as the  names of their cats or spouses as their passwords the other way is to use brute  force trying enumeration or all possible combinations of valid password  characters letters numbers and punctuation on some systems until the  password is found short passwords are especially vulnerable to this method  for example a four character password provides only variations on  average guessing times would produce a correct hit a program that  could try a password every millisecond would take only about seconds to  guess a four character password enumeration is less successful where systems  allow longer passwords that include both uppercase and lowercase letters  along with numbers and all punctuation characters of course users must take  advantage of the large password space and must not for example use only  lowercase letters  in addition to being guessed passwords can be exposed as a result of  visual or electronic monitoring an intruder can look over the shoulder of a  user when the user is logging iil and can learn the password  easily by watching the keyboard alternatively anyone with access to the  network on which a computer resides can seamlessly add a network monitor  allowing him to watch all data being transferred on the network  including user ids and passwords encrypting the data stream containing the  password solves this problem even such a system could have passwords  stolen however for example if a file is used to contain the passwords it  could be copied for off system analysis or consider a trojan horse program  installed on the system that captures every keystroke before sending it on to  the application    exposure is a particularly severe problem if the password is written down  where it can be read or lost as we shall see some systems force users to select  hard to remember or long passwords which may cause a user to record the  password or to reuse it as a result such systems provide much less security  than systems that allow users to select easy passwords  the final type of password compromise illegal transfer is the result of  human nature most computer installations have a rule that forbids users to  share accounts this rule is sometimes implemented for accounting reasons but  is often aimed at improving security for instance suppose one user id is shared  by several users and a security breach occurs from that user id it is impossible  to know who was using the id at the time the break occurred or even whether  the user was an authorized one with one user per user id any user can be  questioned directly about use of the account in addition the user might notice  something different about the account and detect the break in sometimes  users break account sharing rules to help friends or to circumvent accounting  and this behavior can result in a system s being accessed by unauthorized users   possibly harmful ones  passwords can be either generated by the system or selected by a user  system generated passwords may be difficult to remember and thus users may  write them down as mentioned however user selected passwords are often  easy to guess the user s name or favorite car for example some systems will  check a proposed password for ease of guessing or cracking before accepting it  at some sites administrators occasionally check user passwords and notify a  user if his password is easy to guess some systems also age passwords forcing  users to change their passwords at regular intervals every three months for  instance this method is not foolproof either because users can easily toggle  between two passwords the solution as implemented on some systems is to  record a password history for each user for instance the system could record  the last n passwords and not allow their reuse  several variants on these simple password schemes can be used for  example the password can be changed more frequently in the extren e the  password is changed from session to session a new password is selected   either by the system or by the user at the end of each session and that password  must be used for the next session in such a case even if a password is misused  it can be used only once when the legitimate user tries to use a now invalid  password at the next session he discovers the security violation steps can then  be taken to repair the breached security   encrypted passwords  one problem with all these approaches is the difficulty of keeping the password  secret within the computer how can the system store a password securely yet  allow its use for authentication when the user presents her password the  unix system uses encryption to avoid the necessity of keeping its password  list secret each user has a password the system contains a function that is  extremely difficult the designers hope impossible to invert but is simple  to compute that is given a value x it is easy to compute the function value  f x given a function value j x however it is impossible to compute x this  function is used to encode all passwords only encoded passwords are stored  when a user presents a password it is encoded and compared against the   chapter  stored encoded password even if the stored encoded password is seen it  camot be decoded so the password cannot be determined thus the password  file does not need to be kept secret the functionf x is typically an encryption  algorithm that has been designed and tested rigorously  the flaw in this method is that the system no longer has control over  the passwords although the passwords are encrypted anyone with a copy  of the password file can run fast encryption routines against it encrypting  each word in a dictionary for instance and comparing the results against  the passwords if the user has selected a password that is also a word in the  dictionary the password is cracked on sufficiently fast computers or even  on clusters of slow computers such a comparison may take only a few hours  furthermore because unix systems use a well known encryption algorithm  a cracker might keep a cache of passwords that have been cracked previously  for these reasons new versions of unix store the encrypted password entries in  a file readable only by the the programs that compare a presented  password to the stored password run setuid to root so they can read this file  but other users cannot they also include a salt or recorded random number  in the encryption algorithm the salt is added to the password to ensure that  if two plaintext passwords are the same they result in different ciphertexts  another weakness in the unix password methods is that many unix  systems treat only the first eight characters as significant it is therefore  extremely important for users to take advantage of the available password  space to avoid the dictionary encryption method some systems disallow the  use of dictionary words as passwords a good technique is to generate your  password by using the first letter of each word of an easily remembered phrase  using both upper and lower characters with a number or punctuation mark  thrown in for good measure for example the phrase my mother s name is  katherine might yield the password mmn isk the password is hard to  crack but easy for the user to remember   one time passwords  to avoid the problems of password sniffing and shoulder surfing a system  could use a set of paired when a session begins the system  randomly selects and presents one part of a password pair the user must  supply the other part in this system the user is challenged and must  with the correct answer to that challenge  this approach can be generalized to the use of an algorithm as a password  the algorithm might be an integer function for example the system selects  a random integer and presents it to the user the user applies a function and  replies with the correct result the system also applies the function if the two  results match access is allowed  such algorithmic passwords are not susceptible to reuse that is a user can  type in a password and no entity intercepting that password will be able to  reuse it in this scheme the system and the user share a secret the secret is  never transmitted over a medium that allows exposure rather the secret is  used as input to the function along with a shared seed a is a random  number or alphanumeric sequence the seed is the authentication challenge  from the computer the secret and the seed are used as input to the function  f secret seed the result of this function is transmitted as the password to the    computer becallse the computer also knows the secret and the seed it can  perform the same computation if the results match the user is authenticated  the next time the user needs to be authenticated another seed is generated  and the same ensue this time the password is different  in this system the password is different in each  instance anyone capturing the password from one session and trying to reuse  it in another session will fail one time passwords are among the only ways to  prevent improper authentication clue to password exposure  one time password systems are implemented in various ways commer\\xad cial implementations such as securid use hardware calculators most of these  calculators are shaped like a credit card a key chain dangle or a usb device  they include a display and may or may not also have a keypad some use  the current time as the random seed others the user to enter the  shared secret also known as a or on the  keypad the display then shows the one time password the use of both a  one time password generator and a pin is one form of two different types of components are needed in this case two factor  authentication offers far better authentication protection than single factor  authentication  another variation on one time passwords uses a or  which is a list of single use passwords each password on the list is used  once and then is crossed out or erased the commonly used s key system  uses either a software calculator or a code book based on these calculations  as a source of one time passwords of course the user must protect his code  book   biometrics  yet another variation on the use of passwords for authentication involves  the use of biometric measures palm or hand readers are commonly used to  secure physical access for example access to a data center these readers  match stored parameters against what is being read from hand reader pads  the parameters can include a temperature map as well as finger length finger  width and line patterns these devices are currently too large and expensive  to be used for normal computer authentication  fingerprint readers have become accurate and cost effective and should  become more common in the future these devices read finger ridge patterns  and convert them into a sequence of numbers over time they can store a set of  sequences to adjust for the location of the finger on the reading pad and other  factors software can then scan a finger on the pad and compare its features  with these stored sequences to determine if they match of course multiple  users can have profiles stored and the scanner can differentiate among them  a very accurate two factor authentication scheme can result from requiring  a password as well as a user name and fingerprint scan if this information  is encrypted in transit the system can be very resistant to spoofing or replay  attack  is better still consider how strong authentica\\xad tion can be with a usb device that must be plugged into the system a pin and  a fingerprint scan except for the user s having to place her finger on a pad and  plug the usb into the system this authentication method is no less convenient   chapter   that using normal passwords recall though that strong authentication by  itself is not sufficient to guarantee the id of the user an authenticated session  can still be hijacked if it is not encrypted  just as there are myriad threats to system and network security there are many  security solutions the solutions run the gamut from improved user education  through technology to bug free software most security professionals  subscribe to the theory of which states that more layers  of defense are better than fewer layers of course this theory applies to any  kind of security consider the security of a house without a door lock with  a door lock and with a lock and an alarm in this section we look at the  major methods tools and techniques that can be used to improve resistance  to threats   security policy  toward improving the security of any aspect of computing is to  have a policies vary widely but generally include a statement  of what is being secured for example a policy might state that all outside\\xad accessible applications must have a code review before being deployed or that  users should not share their passwords or that all connection points between a  company and the outside must have port scans nm every six months without  a policy in place it is impossible for users and administrators to know what  is permissible what is required and what is not allowed the policy is a road  map to security and if a site is trying to move from less secure to more secure  it needs a map to know how to get there  once the security policy is in place the people it affects should know it  well it should be their guide the policy should also be a  that is reviewed and updated periodically to ensure that it is still pertinent and  still followed   vulnerability assessment  how can we determine whether a security policy has been correctly imple\\xad mented the best way is to execute a vulnerability assessment such assess\\xad ments can cover broad ground from social engineering through risk assess\\xad ment to port scans rlsl for example endeavors to value the  assets of the entity in question a program a management team a system or  a facility and determine the odds that a security incident will affect the entity  and decrease its value when the odds of suffering a loss and the amount of the  potential loss are known a value can be placed on trying to secure the entity  the core activity of most vulnerability assessments is a     \\xad in which the entity is scanned for known vulnerabilities because this book  is concerned with operating systems and the software that runs on them we  concentrate on those aspects of vulnerability assessment  vulnerability scans typically are done at times when computer use is  relatively low to minimize their impact when appropriate they are done on    test systems rather than production systems because they can induce unhappy  behavior from the target systems or network devices  a scan within an individual system can check a variety of aspects of the  system  short or easy to guess passwords  unauthorized privileged programs such as setuid programs  unauthorized programs in system directories  unexpectedly long running processes  improper directory protections on user and system directories  improper protections on system data files such as the password file device  drivers or the operating system kernel itself  dangerous entries in the program search path for example the trojan  horse discussed in section   changes to system programs detected with checksum values  unexpected or hidden network daemons  any problems found by a security scan can be either fixed automatically or  reported to the managers of the system  networked computers are much more susceptible to security attacks than  are standalone systems rather than attacks from a known set of access  points such as directly connected terminals we face attacks from an unknown  and large set of access points a potentially severe security problem to a  lesser extent systems connected to telephone lines via modems are also more  exposed  in fact the u s government considers a system to be only as secure as its  most far reaching connection for instance a top secret system may be accessed  only from within a building also considered top secret the system loses its top\\xad secret rating if any form of communication call occur outside that environment  some government facilities take extreme security precautions the connectors  that plug a terminal into the secure computer are locked in a safe in the office  when the terminal is not in use a person must have proper id to gain access to  the building and her office must know a physical lock combination and must  know authentication information for the computer itself to gain access to the  computer an example of multifactor authentication  unfortunately for systems administrators and computer security profes\\xad sionals it is frequently impossible to lock a machine in a room and disallow all  remote access for instance the internet network currently connects millions of  computers it is becoming a mission critical indispensable resource for many  companies and individuals if you consider the internet a club then as in any  club with millions of members there are many good members and some bad  members the bad members have many tools they can use to attempt to gain  access to the interconnected computers just as morris did with his worm  vulnerability scans can be applied to networks to address some of the  problems with network security the scans search a network for ports that  respond to a request if services are enabled that should not be access to them  can be blocked or they can be disabled the scans then determine the details of   chapter  the application listening on that port and try to determine if it has any known  vulnerabilities testing those vulnerabilities can determine if the system is  ncisconfigured or lacks needed patches  finally though consider the use of port scanners in the hands of a cracker  rather than someone trying to improve security these tools could help crackers  find vulnerabilities to attack fortunately it is possible to detect port scans  through anomaly detection as we discuss next it is a general challenge to  security that the same tools can be used for good and for harm in fact some  people advocate stating that no tools should be  written to test security because such tools can be used to find and exploit  security holes others believe that this approach to security is not a valid one  pointing out for example that crackers could write their own tools it seems  reasonable that security through obscurity be considered one of the layers  of security only so long as it is not the only layer for example a company  could publish its entire network configuration but keeping that information  secret makes it harder for intruders to know what to attack or to determine  what might be detected even here though a company assuming that such  information will remain a secret has a false sense of security   intrusion detection  and facilities is intimately linked to intrusion detection  as its name suggests strives to detect attempted or successful  intrusions into computer systems and to initiate appropriate responses to the  intrusions intrusion detection encompasses a wide array of techniques that  vary on a number of axes including the following  the time at which detection occurs detection can occur in real time while  the intrusion is occurring or after the fact  the types of inputs examined to detect intrusive activity these may  include user shell commands process system calls and network packet  headers or contents some forms of intrusion might be detected only by  correlating information from several such sources  the range of response capabilities simple forms of response include  alerting an administrator to the potential intrusion or somehow halting  the potentially intrusive activity for example killing a process engaged  in such activity in a sophisticated fonn of response a system might  transparently divert an intruder s activity to a false resource  exposed to the attacker the resource appears real to the attacker and  enables the system to monitor and gain information about the attack  these degrees of freedom in the design space for detecting intrusions have  a wide range of solutions known as  and ids systems raise an alarm  when an intrusion is detected while idp systems act as routers passing traffic  unless an intrusion is detected at which point that traffic is blocked  but just what constitutes an intrusion defining a suitable specification of  intrusion turns out to be quite difficult and thus automatic idss and idps today  settle for one of two less ambitious approaches in the first called  system input or network traffic is examined for    specific behavior patterns or known to indicate attacks a simple  example of signature based detection is scanning network packets for the string   etc passwd targeted for a unix systenl another example is virus detection  software which scans binaries or network packets for lmown viruses  the second approach typically called attempts  through various techniques to detect anomalous behavior within computer  systen s of course not all anomalous system activity indicates an intrusion  but the presumption is that intrusions often induce anomalous behavior an  example of anomaly detection is monitoring system calls of a daemon process  to detect whether the system call behavior deviates from normal patterns  possibly indicating that a buffer overflow has been exploited in the daemon  to corrupt its behavior another example is monitoring shell commands to  detect anomalous commands for a given user or detecting an anomalous login  time for a user either of which may indicate that an attacker has succeeded in  gaining access to that user s account  signature based detection and anomaly detection can be viewed as two  sides of the same coin signature based detection attempts to characterize  dangerous behaviors and to detect when one of these behaviors occurs  whereas anomaly detection attempts to characterize normal or non dangerous  behaviors and to detect when something other than these behaviors occurs  these different approaches yield idss and idps with very different proper\\xad ties however in particular anomaly detection can find previously unknown  methods of intrusion so called signature based detection  in contrast will identify only known attacks that can be codified in a rec\\xad ognizable pattern thus new attacks that were not contemplated when the  signatures were generated will evade signature based detection this problem  is well known to vendors of virus detection software who must release new  signatures with great frequency as new viruses are detected manually  anomaly detection is not necessarily superior to signature based detection  however indeed a significant challenge for systems that attempt anomaly  detection is to benchmark normal system behavior accurately if the system  has already been penetrated when it is benchmarked then the intrusive activity  may be included in the normal benchmark even if the system is bench\\xad inarked cleanly without influence from intrusive behaviorf the benchmark  must give a fairly complete picture of normal behavior otherwise the number  of false alarms orf worse missed intrusions  will be excessive  to illustrate the impact of even a marginally high rate of false alarms  consider an installation consisting of a hundred unix workstations from which  security relevant events are recorded for purposes of intrusion detection a  small installation such as this could easily generate a million audit records per  day only one or two might be worthy of an administrator s investigation if we  suppose optimistically that each actual attack is reflected in ten audit recordsf  we can roughly compute the rate of occurrence of audit records reflecting truly  intrusive activity as follows   intrusions  recor s  mtrusn   chapter  interpreting this as a probability of occurrence of intrusive records we  denote it as p i that is event i is the occurrence of a record reflecting truly  intrusive behavior since p i  we also know that p i  p i   now we let a denote the raising of an alarm by an ids an accurate ids  should maximize both p i la and p i i a that is the probabilities that an  alarm indicates an intrusion and that no alarm indicates no intrusion focusil g  on for the moment we can compute it using  now consider the impact ofthe false alarm rate p ai i on p iia even  with a very good true alarm rate of p ail  a seemingly good false\\xad alarm rate of p ai i  yields p iia  that is fewer than one  ill every seven alarms indicates a real intrusion in systems where a security  administrator ilwestigates each alarm a high rate of false alarms called a   christmas tree effect is exceedingly wasteful and will quickly teach the  admilcistrator to ignore alarms  this example illustrates a general principle for idss and idps for usability  they must offer an extremely low false alarm rate achieving a sufficiently  low false alarm rate is an especially serious challenge for anomaly detection  systems as mentioned because of the difficulties of adequately benchmarking  normal system behavior however research contil ues to improve anomaly\\xad detection techniques intrusion detection software is evolving to implement  signatures anomaly algorithms and other algorithms and to combine the  results to arrive at a more accurate anomaly detection rate   virus protection  as we have seen viruses can and do wreak havoc on systems protection from  viruses thus is an important security concern antivirus programs are often  used to provide this protection some of these programs are effective against  only particular known viruses they work by searching all the programs on  a system for the specific pattern of instructions known to make up the virus  when they find a known pattern they remove the instructions  the program antivirus programs may have catalogs of thousands of viruses  for which they search  both viruses and antivirus software continue to become more sophisticated  some viruses modify themselves as they infect other software to avoid the basic  pattern match approach of antivirus programs antivirus programs ill turn  now look for families of patterns rather than a single pattern to identify a virus  in fact some antivirus programs implement a variety of detection algorithms  they can decompress compressed viruses before checking for a signature  some also look for process anomalies a process opening an executable file  for writing is suspicious for example unless it is a compiler another popular  teducique is to run a program in a which is a controlled or emulated    the tripwire file system  an example of an anomaly detection tool is the  checking tool for unix developed at purdue university tripwire operates on  the premise that many intrusions result in modification of system directories  and files for example an attacker might modify the system programs  perhaps inserting copies with trojan horses or might insert new programs  into directories commonly found in user shell search paths or an intruder  might remove system log files to cover his tracks tripwire is a tool to  monitor file systems for added deleted or changed files and to alert system  administrators to these modifications  the operation of tripwire is controlled by a configurationfile tw config  that enumerates the directories and files to be monitored for changes  deletions or additions each entry in this configuration file includes a  selection mask to specify the file attributes inode attributes that will be  monitored for changes for example the selection mask might specify that a  file s permissions be monitored but its access time be ignored in addition the  selection mask can instruct thatthe file be monitored for changes monitoring  the hash of a file for changes is as good as monitoring the file itselt but storing  hashes of files requires far less room than copying the files themselves  when run initially tripwire takes as input the tw config file and  computes a sign ature for each file or directory consisting of its monitored  attributes inode attributes and hash values these signatures are stored in a  database when run subsequently tripwire inputs both tw config and the  previously stored database recomputes the signature for each file or directory  named in tw conf ig and compares this signature with the signature if any  in the previously compl j ted database events reported to an administrator  include any monitored file or directory whose signature differs from that in  the database a changed file any file or directory in a monitored directory  for which a signature does not exist in the database an added file and any  signature in the database for which the corresponding file or directory no  longer exists a deleted file  although effective for a wide class of attacks tripwire does have limita\\xad tions perhaps the most obvious is the need to protect the tripwire program  and its associated files especially the database file from unauthorized mod\\xad ification for this reason tripwire and its associated files should be stored  on some tamper proof medium such as a write protected disk or a secure  server where logins can be tightly controlled unforhm ately this makes it  less convenient to update the database after authorized updates to moni\\xad tored directories and files a second limitation is that some security relevant  files for example system log files are supposed to change over time and  tripwire does not provide a way to distinguish between an authorized and  an unauthorized change so for example an attack that modifies without  deleting a system log that would normally change anyway would escape  tripwire s detection capabilities the best tripwire can do in this case is to  detectcertain obvious inconsistencies for example a shrinking log file free  and commercial versions of tripwire are available from http tripwire org  and http tripwire com   chapter  section of the system the antivirus software analyzes the behavior of the code  in the sandbox before letting it run unmonitored some antivirus programs also  put up a complete shield rather than just scanning files within a file system  they search boot sectors menlory inbound and outbound e mail files as they  are downloaded files on removable devices or media and so on  the best protection against computer viruses is prevention or the practice  of purchasing unopened software from vendors and avoiding  free or pirated copies from public sources or disk exchange offer the safest  route to preventing infection however even new copies of legitimate software  applications are not immune to virus infection in a few cases disgruntled  employees of a software company have infected the master copies of software  programs to do economic harm to the company for macro viruses one defense  is to exchange microsoft word documents in an alternative file format called  unlike the native word format rtf does not include the  capability to attach macros  another defense is to avoid opening any e mail attachments from unknown  users unfortunately history has shown that e mail vulnerabilities appear as  fast as they are fixed for example in the love bug virus became very  widespread by traveling in e mail messages that pretended to be love notes  sent by friends of the receivers once a receiver opened the attached visual  basic script the virus propagated by sending itself to the first addresses in the  receiver s e mail contact list fortunately except for clogging e mail systems  and users inboxes it was relatively harmless it did however effectively  negate the defensive strategy of opening attachments only from people known  to the receiver a more effective defense method is to avoid opening any e mail  attachment that contains executable code some companies now enforce this  as policy by removing all incoming attachments to e mail messages  another safeguard although it does not prevent infection does permit  early detection a user must begin by completely reformatting the hard disk  especially the boot sector which is often targeted for viral attack only secure  software is uploaded and a signature of each program is taken via a secure  message digest computation the resulting filename and associated message\\xad digest list must then be kept free from unauthorized access periodically or  each time a program is run the operating system recomputes the signature and  compares it with the signature on the original list any differences serve as a  warning of possible infection this technique can be combined with others for  example a high overhead antivirus scan such as a sandbox can be used and  if a program passes the test a signature can be created for it if the signatures  match the next time the program is run it does not need to be virus scanned  again   auditing accounting and logging  auditing accounting and logging can decrease system performance but they  are useful in several areas including security logging can be general or  specific all system call executions can be logged for analysis of program  behavior or misbehavior more typically suspicious events are logged  authentication failures and authorization failures can tell us quite a lot about  break in attempts    accounting is another potential tool in a security administrator s kit it  can be used to find performance changes which in tum can reveal security  problems one of the early unix computer break ins was detected by cliff  stoll when he was examning accounting logs and spotted an anomaly  we turn next to the question of how a trusted computer can be connected  safely to an untrustworthy network one solution is the use of a firewall to  separate trusted and unh·usted systems a is a computer appliance  or router that sits between the trusted and the untrusted a network firewall  limits network access between the two and monitors and  logs all connections it can also limit coru ections based on source or destination  address source or destination port or direction of the connection for instance  web servers use http to communicate with web browsers a firewall therefore  may allow only http to pass from all hosts outside the firewall to the web  server within the firewall the morris internet worm used the finger protocol  to break into computers so finger would not be allowed to pass for example  in fact a network firewall can separate a network into multiple domains  a common implementation has the internet as the untrusted domain a  semitrusted and semisecure network called the  as another domain and a company s computers as a third domain figure   coru ections are allowed from the internet to the dmz computers and  from the company computers to the internet but are not allowed from the  internet or dmz computers to the company computers optionally controlled  commurucations may be allowed between the dmz and one company computer  or more for instance a web server on the dmz may need to query a database  server on the corporate network with a firewall however access is contained  and any dmz systems that are broken into still are unable to access the company  computers  internet internet access from company s  computers  r   i company computers  access between dmz and  company s computers  figure domain separation via firewall   chapter   of course a firewall itself must be secure and attack proof otherwise  its ability to secure connections can be compromised furthermore firewalls  do not prevent attacks that or travel within protocols or comections  that the firewall allows a buffer overflow attack to a web server will not be  stopped by the firewall for example because the http connection is allowed  it is the contents of the http connection that house the attack likewise denial\\xad of service attacks can affect firewalls as much as any other machines another  vulnerability of firewalls is in which an unauthorized host pretends  to be an authorized host by meeting some authorization criterion for example  if a firewall rule allows a connection from a host and identifies that host by its  ip address then another host could send packets using that same address and  be allowed through the firewall  in addition to the most common network firewalls there are other newer  kinds of firewalls each with its pros and cons a is a  software layer either included with the operating system or added as an  application rather than limiting communication between security domains it  limits communication to and possibly from a given host a user could add  a personal firewall to her pc so that a trojan horse would be denied access to  the network to which the pc is connected for example an prex y  understands the protocols that applications speak across the network  for example smtp is used for mail transfer an application proxy accepts a  comection just as an smtp server would and then initiates a connection to  the original destination smtp server it can monitor the traffic as it forwards  the message watching for and disabling illegal commands attempts to exploit  bugs and so on some firewalls are designed for one specific protocol an  for example has the specific purpose of analyzing xml traffic  and blocking disallowed or malformed xml sit between  applications and the kernel monitoring system call execution for example  in solaris the least privilege feature implements a list of more than fifty  system calls that processes may or may not be allowed to make a process that  does not need to spawn other processes can have that ability taken away for  instance  the u s department of defense trusted computer system evaluation criteria  specify four security classifications in systems a b c and d this specification  is widely used to determine the security of a facility and to model security  solutions so we explore it here the lowest level classification is division d or  minimal protection division d includes only one class and is used for systems  that have failed to meet the requirements of any of the other security classes  for instance ms dos and windows are in division d  division c the next level of security provides discretionary protection and  accountability of users and their actions through the use of audit capabilities  division c has two levels c and c a c class system incorporates some  form of controls that allow users to protect private information and to  keep other users from accidentally reading or destroying their data a c  environment is one in which cooperating users access data at the same levels  of sensitivity most versions of unix are c class    the total of all protection systems within a computer system hardware  software firmware that correctly enforce a security policy is known as a  the tcb of a cl system controls access between  users and files by allowing the user to specify and control sharing of objects  by named individuals or defined groups in addition the tcb requires that the  users identify themselves before they start any activities that the tcb is expected  to mediate this identification is accomplished via a protected mechanism or  password the tcb protects the authentication data so that they are inaccessible  to unauthorized users  a c class system adds an individual level access control to the require\\xad ments of a cl system for example access rights of a file can be specified  to the level of a single individual in addition the system adrninistrator can  selectively audit the actions of any one or more users based on individual  identity the tcb also protects itself from modification of its code or data  structures in addition no information produced by a prior user is available  to another user who accesses a storage object that has been released back to  the system some speciat secure versions of unix have been certified at the c  level  division b mandatory protection systems have all the properties of a class\\xad c system in addition they attach a sensitivity label to each object the bl class  tcb maintains the security label of each object in the system the label is used  for decisions pertaining to mandatory access control for example a user  at the confidential level could not access a file at the more sensitive secret  level the tcb also denotes the sensitivity level at the top and bottom of each  page of any human readable output in addition to the normal user name\\xad password authentication information the tcb also maintains the clearance  and authorizations of individual users and will support at least two levels of  security these levels are hierarchicat so that a user may access any objects  that carry sensitivity labels equal to or lower than his security clearance for  example a secret level user could access a file at the confidential level in the  absence of other access controls processes are also isolated through the use of  distinct address spaces  a b class system extends the sensitivity labels to each system resource  such as storage objects physical devices are assigned minimum and maximum  security levels that the system uses to enforce constraints imposed by the  physical environments in which the devices are located in addition a b  system supports covert channels and the auditing of events that could lead to  the exploitation of a covert channel  a b class system allows the creation of access control lists that denote  users or groups not granted access to a given named object the tcb also  contains a mechanism to monitor events that may indicate a violation of  security policy the mechanism notifies the security administrator and if  necessary terminates the event in the least disruptive manner  the highest level classification is division a architecturally a class al  system is functionally equivalent to a b system but it uses formal design  specifications and verification techniques granting a high degree of assurance  that the tcb has been implemented correctly a system beyond class al might  be designed and developed in a trusted facility by trusted personnel  the use of a tcb merely ensures that the system can enforce aspects of a  security policy the tcb does not specify what the policy should be typically   chapter   a given computing environment develops a security policy for  and has the plan by a security agency such as the national  computer security center certain computing environments may require other  certification such as that supplied by tempest which guards against electronic  eavesdropping for example a tempest certified system has terminals that  are shielded to prevent electromagnetic fields from escaping this shielding  ensures that equipment outside the room or building where the terminal is  housed camwt detect what information is being displayed by the terminal  microsoft windows xp is a general purpose operating system designed to  support a variety of security features and methods in this section we examine  features that windows xp uses to perform security functions for more  information and background on wilcdows xp see chapter  the windows xp security model is based on the notion of  windows xp allows the creation of any number of user accounts which can  be grouped in any manner access to system objects can then be permitted or  denied as desired users are identified to the system by a unique security id  when a user logs on windows xp creates a that includes  the security id for the user security ids for any groups of which the user is  a member and a list of any special privileges that the user has examples  of special privileges include backing up files and directories shutting down  the computer logging on interactively and changing the system clock every  process that windows xp runs on behalf of a user will receive a copy of the  access token the system uses the security ids in the access token to permit or  deny access to system objects whenever the user or a process on behalf of the  user attempts to access the object authentication of a user account is typically  accomplished via a user name and password although the modular design of  windows xp allows the development of custom authentication packages for  example a retinal or eye scanner might be used to verify that the user is who  she says she is  windows xp uses the idea of a subject to ensure that programs run by a  user do not get greater access to the system than the user is authorized to have  a is used to track and manage permissions for each program that a  user runs it is composed of the user s access token and the program acting  on behalf of the user since windows xp operates with a client server model  two classes of subjects are used to control access simple subjects and server  subjects an example of a is the typical application program  that a user executes after she logs on simple subject is assigned a  based on the security access token of the user a is a  process implemented as a protected server that uses the security context of the  client when acting on the client s behalf  as mentioned in section auditing is a useful security technique  windows xp has blilt in auditing that allows many common security threats  to be monitored examples include failure auditing for login and logoff events  to detect random password break ins success auditing for login and logoff  events to detect login activity at strange hours success and failure write access  auditing for executable files to track a virus outbreak and success and failure  auditing for file access to detect access to sensitive files     security attributes of an object in windows xp are described by a  the security descriptor contains the security id of the owner   who can change the access permissions a group security id used  the posix subsystem a discretionary access control list that identifies  users or groups are allowed and which are not allowed access and  a system access control list that controls which auditing messages the system  will generate for example the security descriptor of the file foo bar might have  owner avi and this discretionary access control list  a vi all access  group cs read write access  user cliff no access  in addition it might have a system access control list of audit writes by  everyone  an access control list is composed of access control entries that contain  the security id of the individual and an access mask that defines all possible  actions on the object with a value of accessallowed or accessdenied for  each action files in windows xp may have the following access types read\\xad data writedata appenddata execute readextendedattribute write\\xad extendedattribute readattributes and wri teattributes we can see  how this allows a fine degree of control over access to objects  windows xp classifies objects as either container objects or noncontainer  objects such as directories can logically contain other  objects by default an object is created within a container object the new  object inherits permissions from the parent object similarly if the user copies a  file from one directory to a new directory the file will inherit the permissions of  the destination directory inherit no other permissions  furthermore if a permission is changed on a directory the new permissions  do not automatically apply to existing files and subdirectories the user may  explicitly apply them if she so desires  the system administrator can prohibit printilig to a printer on the system  for all or part of a day and can use the windows xp performance monitor to  help her spot approaching problems in general windows xp does a good job  of providing features to help ensure a secure computing environment many of  these features are not enabled by default however which may be one reason  for the myriad security breaches on windows xp systems another reason is  the vast number of services windows xp starts at system boot tiine and the  number of applications that typically are installed on a windows xp system  for a real multiuser environment the system administrator should formulate  a security plan and implement it using the features that windows xp provides  and other security tools  protection is an internal problem security in contrast must consider both  the computer system and the environment people buildings businesses  valuable objects and threats within which the system is used   chapter  the data stored in the computer system must be protected from unautho\\xad rized access malicious destruction or alteration and accidental introduction of  inconsistency it is easier to protect against accidental loss of data consistency  than to protect against malicious access to the data absolute protection of the  information stored

to identify legitimate users of a  system in addition to standard user name and password protection several  authentication methods are used one time passwords for example change  from session to session to avoid replay attacks two factor authentication  requires two forms of authentication such as a hardware calculator with an  activation pin multifactor authentication uses three or more

that do not share mem\\xad ory or a clock instead each processor has its own local memory and the  processors communicate with one another through communication lines  such as local area or wide area networks the processors in a distributed  system vary in size and function such systems may include small hand\\xad held or real time devices personal computers workstations and large  mainframe computer systems  a distributed file system is a file service system whose users servers  and storage devices are dispersed among the sites of a distributed  system accordingly service activity has to be carried out across the  network instead of a single centralized data repository there are multiple  independent storage devices  the benefits of a distributed system include giving users access to  the resources maintained by the system and thereby speeding up com\\xad putation and improving data availability and reliability because a system is  distributed however it must provide mechanisms for process synchro\\xad nization and communication for dealing with the deadlock problem and  for handling failures that are not encountered in a centralized system    a distributed system is a collection of processors that do not share memory  or a clock instead each processor has its own local memory the processors  communicate with one another through various communication networks  such as high speed buses or telephone lines in this chapter we discuss the  general structure of distributed systems and the networks that interconnect  them we contrast the main differences in operating system design between  these systems and centralized systems in chapter we go on to discuss  distributed file systems then i chapter we describe the methods  necessary for distributed operating systems to coordinate their actions  to provide a high level overview of distributed systems and the networks  that interconnect them  to discuss the general structure of distributed operating systems  a is a collection of loosely coupled processors intercon\\xad nected by a communication network from the point of view of a specific  processor in a distributed system the rest of the processors and their respective  resources are remote whereas its own resources are local  the processors in a distributed system may vary in size and function  they may include small microprocessors workstations minicomputers and  large general purpose cornputer systems these processors are referred to by a  number of names such as sites nodes computers machines and hosts depending  on the context in which they are mentioned we mainly use site to indicate the  location of a machine and host to refer to a specific system at a site generally  one host at one site the server has a resource that another host at another  site the client or user would like to use a general structure of a distributed  system is shown in figure     chapter  site a site c  network  communication  site b  figure a distributed system d d d d  l resources l  there are four major reasons for building distributed systems resource  sharing computation speedup reliability and communication in this section we  briefly discuss each of them   resource sharing  if a number of different sites with different capabilities are connected to one  another then a user at one site may be able to use the resources available at  another for example a user at site a may be using a laser printer located at  site b meanwhile a user at b may access a file that resides at a in general  in a distributed system provides mechanisms for sharing  files at remote sites processing information in a distributed database printing  files at remote sites using remote specialized hardware devices such as a  high speed array processor and performing other operations   computation speedup  if a particular computation can be partitioned into subcomputations that  can run concurrently then a distributed system allows us to distribute  the subcomputations among the various sites the subcomputations can be  run concurrently and thus provide in addition if  a particular site is currently overloaded with jobs some of them can be  moved to other lightly loaded sites this movement of jobs is called  automated load sharing in which the distributed operating system  automatically moves jobs is not yet comnlon in commercial systems   reliability  if one site fails in a distributed system the remammg sites can continue  operating giving the system better reliability if the system is composed of  multiple large autonomous installations that is general purpose computers  the failure of one of them should not affect the rest if however the system     is composed of sncall machines each of which is responsible for some crucial  system function such as tenninal character i or the file system then a single  failure may halt the operation of the whole system in general with enough  redundancy in both hardware and data the system can continue operation  even if some of its sites have failed  the failure of a site must be detected by the system and appropriate action  may be needed to recover from the failure the system must no longer use the  services of that site in addition if the function of the failed site can be taken  over by another site the system must ensure that the transfer of function occurs  correctly finally when the failed site recovers or is repaired mechanisms must  be available to integrate it back into the system smoothly as we shall see in  chapters and these actions present difficult problems that have many  possible solutions   communication  when several sites are connected to one another by a communication network  users at the various sites have the opportunity to exchange information at  a low level are passed between systems much as messages are  passed between processes in the single computer message system discussed  in section given message passing all the higher level flmctionality found  in standalone systems can be expanded to encompass the distributed system  such functions include file transfer login mail and remote procedure calls   rpcs  the advantage of a distributed system is that these functions can be  carried out over great distances two people at geographically distant sites can  collaborate on a project for example by transferring the files of the project  logging in to each other s remote systems to run programs and exchanging  mail to coordinate the work users minimize the limitations inherent in long\\xad distance work we wrote this book by collaborating in such a manner  the advantages of distributed systems have resulted in an industry wide  trend toward dovmslzing many companies are replacing their mainframes  with networks of workstations or personal computers companies get a bigger  bang for the buck that is better functionality for the cost more flexibility in  locating resources and expanding facilities better user interfaces and easier  maintenance  in this section we describe the two general categories of network oriented  operating systems network operating systems and distributed operating  systems network operating systems are simpler to implement but generally  more difficult for users to access and utilize than are distributed operating  systems which provide more features   network operating systems  a operating provides an environment in which users who are  aware of the multiplicity of machines can access remote resources by either   chapter  logging in to the appropriate remote machine or transferring data from the  remote machine to their own machines   remote login  an important function of a network operating system is to allow users to log in  remotely the internet provides the telnet facility for this p npose to illustrate  this facility lets suppose that a user at westminster college wishes to compute  on cs yale edu a computer that is located at yale university to do so the  user must have a valid account on that machine to log in remotely the user  issues the command  telnet cs yale edu  this command results in the formation of a socket connection between the  local machine at westminster college and the cs yale edu computer after this  connection has been established the networking software creates a transparent  bidirectional link so that all characters entered by the user are sent to a process  on cs yale edu and all the output from that process is sent back to the user the  process on the remote machine asks the user for a login name and a password  once the correct information has been received the process acts as a proxy for  the user who can compute on the remote machine just as any local user can   remote file transfer  another major function of a network operating system is to provide a  mechanism for remote file transfer from one machine to another in such  an enviromnent each computer maintains its own local file system if a user at  one site say cs uvm edu wants to access a file located on another computer   say cs yale edu then the file must be copied explicitly from the computer  at yale to the computer at the university of vermont  the internet provides a mechanism for such a transfer with the file transfer  protocol ftp program suppose that a user on cs uvm edu wants to copy a  java program server java that resides on cs yale edu the user must first  invoke the ftp program by executing  ftp cs yale edu  the program then asks the user for a login name and a password once  the correct information has been received the user must connect to the  subdirectory where the file server java resides and then copy the file by  executing  get server java  in this scheme the file location is not transparent to the user users must know  exactly where each file is moreover there is no real file sharing because a user  can only copy a file from one site to another thus several copies of the same  file may exist resulting in a waste of space tn addition if these copies are  modified the vario us copies will be inconsistent    notice that in our example the user at the university of vermont must  have login permission on cs yale edu ptp also provides a way to allow a user  who does not have an account on the yale computer to copy files remotely this  remote copying is accomplished through the anonymous ft p method which  works as follows the file to be copied that is server java must be placed  in a special subdirectory say jtp with the protection set to allow the public  to read the file a user who wishes to copy the file uses the ftp command as  before when the user is asked for the login nan le the user supplies the name   anonymous and an arbitrary password  once anonymous login is accomplished care must be taken by the system  to ensure that this partially authorized user does not access inappropriate  files generally the user is allowed to access only those files that are in the  directory tree of user anonymous any files placed here are accessible to  any anonymous users subject to the usual file protection scheme used on  that machine anonymous users however cam lot access files outside of this  directory tree  implementation of the ftp mechanism is similar to telnet implementation  a daemon on the remote site watches for requests to coru lect to the system s ptp  port login authentication is accomplished and the user is allowed to execute  commands remotely unlike the telnet daemon which executes any command  for the user the ptp daemon responds only to a predefined set of file related  commands these include the following  get transfer a file from the remote machine to the local machine  put transfer from the local machine to the remote machine  ls or dir list files in the current directory on the remote machine  cd change the current directory on the remote machine  there are also various commands to change transfer modes for binary or ascii  files and to determine connection status  an important point about telnet and ptp is that they require the user to  change paradigms ptp requires the user to know a command set entirely  different from the normal operating system commands telnet requires a  smaller shift the user must know appropriate commands on the remote system  for instance a user on a windows machine who teh lets to a unix machine  must switch to unix commands for the duration of the telnet session facilities  are more convenient for users if they do not require the use of a different  set of commands distributed operating systems are designed to address this  problem   distributed operating systems  in a distributed operating system users access remote resources in the same  way they access local resources data and process migration from one site to  another is under the control of the distributed operating system   data migration  suppose a user on site a wants to access data such as a file that reside at site  b the system can transfer the data by one of two basic methods one approach   chapter  to is to transfer the entire file to site a from that point on all  access to the file is local when the user no longer needs access to the file a  copy of the file if it has been modified is sent back to site b even if only a  modest change has been made to a large file all the data must be transferred  this mechanism can be thought of as an automated ftp system this approach  was used in the andrew file system as we discuss in chapter but it was  found to be too inefficient  the other approach is to transfer to site a only those portions of the file  that are actually necessary for the immediate task if another portion is required  later another transfer will take place when the user no longer wants to access  the file any part of it that has been modified must be sent back to site b note  the similarity to demand paging the sun microsystems network file system   nfs protocol uses this method chapter as do newer versions of andrew  the microsoft smb protocol running on top of either tcp ip or the microsoft  netbeui protocol also allows file sharing over a network smb is described in  appendix c  clearly if only a small part of a large file is being accessed the latter  approach is preferable if significant portions of the file are being accessed  however it is more efficient to copy the entire file in both methods data  migration includes more than the mere transfer of data from one site to another  the system must also perform various data translations if the two sites involved  are not directly compatible for instance if they use different character code  representations or represent integers with a different number or order of bits   computation migration  in some circumstances we may want to transfer the computation rather than  the data across the system this approach is called for  example consider a job that needs to access various large files that reside at  different sites to obtain a summary of those files it would be more efficient to  access the files at the sites where they reside and return the desired results to  the site that il itiated the computation generally if the time to transfer the data  is longer than the time to execute the remote cmmnand the remote command  should be used  such a computation can be carried out in different ways suppose that  process p wants to access a file at site a access to the file is carried out at  site a and could be il itiated by an rpc an rpc uses a   udp on the internet to execute a routine on a remote system section   process p invokes a predefilced procedure at site a the procedure executes  appropriately and then returns the results to p  alternatively process p can send a message to site a the operatil g system  at site a then creates a new process q whose function is to carry out the  designated task when process q completes its execution it sends the needed  result back to p via the message system in this scheme process p may execute  concurrently with process q in fact it may have several processes running  concurrently on several sites  either method could be used to access several files residing at various sites  one rpc might result in the ilwocation of another rpc or even in the transfer  of messages to another site similarly process q could duril g the course of its     execution send a message to another site which in turn would create another  process this process might either send a message back to q or repeat the cycle   process migration  a logical extension of computation migration is na  c  process is submitted for execution it is not always executed at  it is initiated the entire process or parts of it may be executed at different  sites this scheme may be used for several reasons  load balancing the processes or subprocesses may be distributed across  the network to even the workload  computation speedup if a single process can be divided into a number  of subprocesses that can run concurrently on different sites then the total  process turnaround time can be reduced  hardware preference the process may have characteristics that make it  more suitable for execution on some specialized processor such as matrix  inversion on an array processor rather than on a microprocessor  software preference the process may require software that is available  at only a particular site and either the software cannot be moved or it is  less expensive to move the process  data access just as in computation migration if the data being used in the  computation are numerous it may be more efficient to have a process run  remotely than to transfer all the data  we use two complementary techniques to move processes in a computer  network in the first the system can attempt to hide the fact that the process has  migrated from the client this scheme has the advantage that the user does not  need to code her program explicitly to accomplish the migration this method  is usually employed for achieving load balancing and computation speedup  among homogeneous systems as they do not need user input to help them  execute programs remotely  the other approach is to allow or require the user to specify explicitly  how the process should migrate this method is usually employed when the  process must be moved to satisfy a hardware or software preference  you have probably realized that the web has many aspects of a distributed\\xad computing environment certainly it provides data migration between a web  server and a web client it also provides computation migration for instance  a web client could trigger a database operation on a web server finally with  java it provides a form of process migration java applets are sent from the  server to the client where they are executed a network operating system  provides most of these features but a distributed operating system makes  them seamless and easily accessible the result is a powerful and easy to use  facility one of the reasons for the huge growth of the world wide web  there are basically two types of networks and  the main difference between the two is the way in   chapter  which they are geographically distributed local area networks are composed  of processors distributed over small areas such as a single building or a number  of adjacent buildings whereas wide area networks are composed of a number  of autonomous processors distributed over a large area such as the united  states these differences imply major variations in the speed and reliability  of the communications networks and they are reflected in the distributed  operating system design   local area networks  local area networks emerged in the early s as a substitute for large  mainframe computer systems for many enterprises it is more economical  to have a number of small computers each with its own self contained  applications than to have a single large system because each small computer  is likely to need a full complement of peripheral devices such as disks  and printers and because some form of data sharing is likely to occur in  a single enterprise it was a natural step to connect these small systems into a  network  lans as mentioned are usually designed to cover a small geographical  area such as a single building or a few adjacent buildings and are generally  used in an office environment all the sites in such systems are close to one  another so the communication links tend to have a higher speed and lower  error rate than do their cou rjerparts in wide area networks high quality   expensive cables are needed to attain this higher speed and reliability it is  also possible to use the cable exclusively for data network traffic over longer  distances the cost of using high quality cable is enormous and the exclusive  use of the cable tends to be prohibitively expensive  the most conunon links in a local area network are twisted pair and fiber\\xad optic cabling the most common configurations are multiaccess bus ring  and star networks communication speeds range from megabit per second  for networks such as appletalk infrared and the new bluetooth local radio  network to gigabit per second for ethernet ten megabits per second  is the speed of requires a higher quality  cable but runs at m egabits per second and is common also growing is the  use of optical fiber based fddi networking the fddi network is token based  and runs at over megabits per second  a typical lan may consist of a number of different computers from  mainframes to laptops or pdas various shared peripheral devices such  as laser printers and magnetic tape drives and one or more gateways   specialized processors that provide access to other networks figure  an  ethernet scheme is commonly used to construct lans an ethernet network  has no central controller because it is a multiaccess bus so new hosts can be  added easily to the network the ethernet protocol is defined by the ieee  standard  there has been significant growth in using the wireless spectrum for  designing local area networks wireless or wifi networks allow constructing  a network using only a wireless router for transmitting signals between hosts  each host has a wireless adapter networking card which allows it to join and  use the wireless network however where ethernet systems often run at  megabits per second wifi networks typically run at slower speeds there are    workstation workstation workstation  printer laptop file server  figure local area network  several ieee standards for wireless networks g can theoretically run at  megabits per second although ilc practice data rates are often less than half that  amount the recent n standard provides theoretically much higher data  rates than g although in actual practice n networks have typical  data rates of around megabits per second data rates of wireless networks  are heavily influenced by the distance between the wireless router and the  host as well as interference in the wireless spectrum wireless networks often  have a physical advantage over wired ethernet networks as no cabling needs  to be run to connect communicatilcg hosts as a result wireless networks are  popular in homes as well as public areas such as libraries and internet cafes   wide area networks  wide area networks emerged in the late s mainly as an academic research  project to provide efficient communication among sites allowing hardware and  software to be shared conveniently and economically by a wide community  of users the first wan to be designed and developed was the arpanet begun  in the arpanet has grown from a four site experimental network to a  worldwide network of networks the internet comprising millions of computer  systems  because the sites in a wan are physically distributed over a large geographi\\xad cal area the communication links are by default relatively slow and unreliable  typical links are telephone lines leased dedicated data lines microwave links  and satellite channels these communication links are controlled by special   figure  which are responsible for defilcing  the interface through which the sites communicate over the network as well  as for transferring information among the various sites   chapter  communication  subsystem h  h netwot·k host  communication  processor  figure communication processors in a wide area network  for example the internet wan enables hosts at geographically separated  sites to communicate with one another the host computers typically differ  from one another in type speed word length operatil g system and so  on hosts are generally on lans which are in turn connected to the  internet via regional networks the regional networks such as nsfnet il  the northeast united states are interlinked with section  to  form the worldwide network connections between networks frequently use a  telephone system service called t which provides a transfer rate of  megabits per second over a leased line for sites requiring faster internet  access tls are collected into multiple t units that work in parallel to provide  more throughput for instance a t is composed of t connections and  has a transfer rate of megabits per second the routers control the path  each message takes through the net this routing may be either dynamic to  increase commmlication efficiency or static to reduce security risks or to allow  communication charges to be computed  other wans use standard telephone lines as their primary means of com\\xad munication are devices that accept digital data from the computer  side and convert it to the analog signals that the telephone system uses a  modem at the destination site converts the analog signal back to digital form  and the destination receives the data the unix news network uucp allows  systems to communicate with each other at predetermined times via modems  to exchange messages the messages are then routed to other nearby systems  and in this way either are propagated to all hosts on the network public  messages or are transferred to specific destinations private messages wans  are generally slower than lans their transmission rates range from bits     per second to over megabit per second uucp has been superseded by ppp  the point to point protocol ppp functions over modem coruections allowing  home computers to be fully connected to the internet  the sites in a distributed system can be connected physically in a variety of  ways each configuration has advantages and disadvantages we can compare  the configurations by using the following criteria  installation cost the cost of physically linking the sites in the system  communication cost the cost in time and money to send a message from  site a to site b  availability the extent to which data can be accessed despite the failure  of some links or sites  the various topologies are depicted in figure as graphs whose nodes  correspond to sites an edge from node a to node b corresponds to a direct  communication link between the two sites in a fully connected network each  site is directly connected to every other site however the number of links  grows as the square of the number of sites resulting in a huge installation cost  therefore fully connected networks are impractical in any large system  in a pc ntially direct links exist between some but  not all pairs of sites hence the installation cost of such a configuration is  lower than that of the fully connected network however if two sites a and  b are not directly connected messages from one to the other must be  through a sequence of communication links this requirement results in a  higher communication cost  if a communication link fails messages that would have been transmitted  across the link must be rerouted in some cases another route through the  network may be found so that the messages are able to reach their destination  in other cases a failure may mean that no connection exists between some  pair or pairs of sites when a system is split into two or more unconnected  subsystems it is partitioned under this definition a subsystem or partition  may consist of a single node  the various partially connected network types include tree structured  networks ring networks and star networks as shown in figure these  types have different failure characteristics and installation and communication  costs installation and communication costs are relatively low for a tree\\xad structured network however the failure of a single link in such a network  can result in the network s becoming partitioned in a ring network at least  two links must fail for partition to occur thus the ring network has a higher  degree of availability than does a tree structured network however the  communication cost is high since a message may have to cross a large number  of links in a star network the failure of a single link results in a network  partition but one of the partitions has only a single site such a partition can be  treated as a single site failure the star network also has a low communication  cost since each site is at most two links away from every other site however   chapter   fully connected network partially connected network  b  d  f  tree structured network star network  f  ring network  figure network topology  if the central site fails all the sites in the system become disconnected from one  another  now that we have discussed the physical aspects of networking we turn to  the internal workings the designer of a communication network must address  five basic issues  naming and name resolution how do two processes locate each other to  communicate  routing strategies how are messages sent through the network  packet strategies are packets sent individually or as a sequence  connection strategies how do two processes send a sequence of mes\\xad sages    contention how do we resolve conflicting demands for the network s  lise given that it is a shared resource  in the following sections we elaborate on each of these issues   naming and name resolution  the first component of network communication is the naming o£ the systems  in the network for a process at site a to exchange information with a process  at site b each must be able to specify the other within a computer system  each process has a process identifier and messages may be addressed with the  process identifier beca·use networked systems share no memory however a  host within the system initially has no knowledge about the processes on other  hosts  to solve this problem processes on remote systems are generally identified  by the pair host name identifier where host name is a name unique within  the network and identifier may be a process identifier or other unique number  within that host a host name is usually an alphanumeric identifier rather than  a number to make it easier for users to specify for instance site a might have  hosts named homer marge bart and lisa bart is certainly easier to remember  than is  names are convenient for humans to use but computers prefer numbers for  speed and simplicity for this reason there must be a mechanism to  the  host name into a that describes the destination system to the networking  hardware this mechanism is similar to the name to address binding that  occurs during program compilation linking loading and execution chapter   in the case of host names two possibilities exist first every host may have a  data file containing the names and addresses of all the other hosts reachable on  the network similar to binding at compile time the problem with this model  is that adding or removing a host from the network requires updati n g the data  files on all the hosts the alternative is to distribute the information among  systems on the network the network must then use a protocol to distribute  and retrieve the information  dns specifies the naming structure of the hosts as well as name to address  resolution hosts on the internet are logically addressed with multipart names  known as ip addresses the parts of an ip address progress frorn the most  specific to the most general part with periods separating the fields for  instance bob cs brown edu refers to host bob in the depattment of  science at brown university within the top level domain edu  domains include com for commercial sites and for organizations as well as  connected to the for systems  the resolves  in reverse order each  a a process on a  a name and returns the address of the name server  as the final the name server for the host in  host id is returned for a made  communicate with bob cs brown edu would result in   chapter  the kernel of system a issues a request to the name server for the edu  domain asking for the address of the name server for brown edu the  name server for the edu domain must be at a known address so that it  can be queried  the edu nance server returns the address of the host on which the brown edu  name server resides  the kernel on system a then queries the name server at this address and  asks about cs brown edu  an address is returned and a request to that address for bob cs brown edu  now finally returns an host id for that host for example     this protocol may seem inefficient but local caches are usually kept by each  name server to speed the process for example the edu name server would  have brown edu in its cache and would inform system a that it could resolve  two portions of the name returning a pointer to the cs brown edu name server  of course the contents of these caches must be refreshed over time in case  the name server is moved or its address changes in fact this service is so  important that many optimizations have occurred in the protocol as well as  many safeguards consider what would happen if the primary edu name server  crashed it is possible that no edu hosts would be able to have their addresses  resolved making them all lmreachable the solution is to use secondary  back up name servers that duplicate the contents of the primary servers  before the domain name service was introduced all hosts on the internet  needed to have copies of a file that contained the names and addresses of each  host on the network all changes to this file had to be registered at one site host  sri nic and periodically all hosts had to copy the updated file from sri nic  to be able to contact new systems or find hosts whose addresses had changed  under the domain name service each name server site is responsible for  updating the host information for that domain for instance any host changes  at brown university are the responsibility of the name server for brown edu  and need not be reported anywhere else dns lookups will automatically  retrieve the updated information because they will contact brown edu directly  within domains there can be autonomous subdomains to further distribute  the responsibility for host name and host id changes  java provides the necessary api to design a program that maps ip names to  ip addresses the program shown in figure is passed an ip name such as  bob cs brown edu on the command line and either outputs the ip address of the  host or returns a message indicating that the host name could not be resolved  an inetaddress is a java class representing an ip name or address the static  method getbyname belonging to the inetaddress class is passed a string  representation of an ip name and it returns the corresponding inetaddress  the program then invokes the gethostaddress method which internally  uses dns to look up the ip address of the designated host  generally the operating system is responsible for accepting from its  processes a message destined for host name identifier and for transferring  that message to the appropriate host the kernel on the destination host is then  responsible for transferring the message to the process named by the identifier  this exchange is by no means trivial it is described in section     i  usage java dnslookup ip name   i e java dnslookup www wiley com   i  public class dnslookup   public static void main string args  inetaddress hostaddress  try   hostaddress inetaddress getbyname args o  system out println hostaddress gethostaddress   catch unknownhostexception uhe     system err println unknown host  args   figure java program illustrating a dns lookup   routing strategies  when a process at site a wants to communicate with a process at site b how  is the message sent if there is only one physical path from a to b such as  in a star or tree structured network the message must be sent through that  path however if there are multiple physical paths from a to b then several  routing options exist each site has a indicating the alternative  paths that can be used to send a message to other sites the table may include  information about the speed and cost of the various communication paths  and it may be updated as necessary either manually or via programs that  exchange routing information the three most common routing schemes are fixed routing a path from a to b is specified in advance and does not  change unless a hardware failure disables it usually the shortest path is  chosen so that communication costs are minimized  virtual routing a path from a to b is fixed for the duration of one  different sessions involving messages from a to b may use different paths  a session could be as short as a file transfer or as long as a remote login  period  dynamic routing the path used to send a message from site a to site  b is chosen only when the message is sent because the decision is made  dynamically separate messages may be assigned different paths site a  will make a decision to send the message to site c c in turn will decide  to send it to sited and so on eventually a site will deliver the message  to b usually a site sends a message to another site on whatever link is the  least used at that particular time  there are tradeoffs among these three schem es fixed routing cannot adapt  to link failures or load changes in other words if a path has been established   chapter  between a and b the messages must be sent along this path even if the path  is down or is used more heavily than another possible path we can partially  remedy this problem by using virtual routing and can avoid it completely by  using dynamic routing fixed routing and virtual routing ensure that ncessages  from a to b will be delivered in the order in which they were sent in dynamic  routing messages may arrive out of order we can remedy this problem by  appending a sequence number to each message  dynamic routing is the most complicated to set up and run however it is  the best way to manage routing in complicated environments unix provides  both fixed routing for use on hosts within simple networks and dynamic  routing for complicated network environments it is also possible to mix the  two within a site the hosts may just need to know how to reach the system that  connects the local network to other networks such as company wide networks  or the internet such a node is known as a each individual host has  a static route to the gateway although the gateway itself uses dynamic routing  to reach any host on the rest of the network  a router is the entity within the computer network responsible for routing  messages a router can be a host computer with routing software or a  special purpose device either way a router must have at least two network  cmmections or else it would have nowhere to route messages a router decides  whether any given message needs to be passed from the network on which  it is received to any other network connected to the router it makes this  determination by examining the destination internet address of the message  the router checks its tables to determine the location of the destination host or  at least of the network to which it will send the message toward the destination  host in the case of static routing this table is changed only by manual update   a new file is loaded onto the router with dynamic routing a  is used between routers to inform them of network changes and to allow them  to update their routing tables automatically gateways and routers typically  are dedicated hardware devices that run code out of firmware   packet strategies  messages generally vary in length to simplify the system design we com\\xad monly implement communication with fixed length messages called  or a communication incplemented in one packet can be  sent to its destination in a a connectionless message  can be in which case the sender has no guarantee that and cannot  tell whether the packet reached its destination alternatively the packet can  be usually in this case a packet is returned from the destination  indicating that the packet arrived of course the return packet could be lost  along the way if a message is too long to fit within one packet or if the packets  need to how back and forth between the two communicators a connection is  established to allow the reliable exchange of multiple packets   connection strategies pairs of processes that  want to communicate over the network can be connected in a number of ways    the three most common schemes are  and  circuit switching if two processes want to conmunicate a permanent  physical link is established between them tlis link is allocated for the  duration of the communication session and no other process can use  that link during this period even if the two processes are not actively  communicating for a while this scheme is similar to that used in the  telephone system once a communication line has been opened between  two parties that is party a calls party b no one else can use this circuit  until the communication is terminated explicitly for example when the  parties hang up  message switching if two processes want to communicate a temporary  link is established for the duration of one message transfer physical  links are allocated dynamically among correspondents as needed and  are allocated for only short periods each message is a block of data  with system information such as the source the destination and error\\xad correction codes ecc that allows the communication network to deliver  the message to the destination correctly this scheme is similar to the  post office mailing system each letter is a message that contains both the  destination address and source return address many messages from  different users can be shipped over the same link  packet switching one logical message may have to be divided into a  number of packets each packet may be sent to its destination separately  and each therefore must include a source and a destination address with its  data furthermore the various packets may take different paths through  the network the packets must be reassembled into messages as they  arrive note that it is not harmful for data to be broken into packets  possibly routed separately and reassembled at the destination breaking  up an audio signal say a telephone communication in contrast could  cause great confusion if it was not done carefully  there are obvious tradeoffs among these schemes circuit switching requires  substantial set up time and may waste network bandwidth but it incurs  less overhead for shipping each message conversely message and packet  switching require less set up time but incur more overhead per message also  in packet switching each message must be divided into packets and later  reassembled packet switching is the method most commonly used on data  networks because it makes the best use of network bandwidth   contention  depending on the network topology a link may cmmect more than two sites  in the computer network and several of these sites may want to transmit  information over a link simultaneously this situation occurs mainly in a ring or  multiaccess bus network in this case the transmitted information may become  scrambled if it does it must be discarded and the sites must be notified about  the problem so that they can retransmit the information if no special provisions  are made this situation may be repeated resulting in degraded performance   chapter   several techniques have been developed to avoid repeated collisions including  collision detection and token passing  csma cd before transmitting a message over a link a site must listen  to determine whether another message is currently being transmitted  over that link this technique is called uvith   if the link is free the site can start transmitting otherwise it must  wait and continue to listen until the link is free if two or more sites begin  transmitting at exactly the same time each thinking that no other site is  using the link then they will register a and will  stop transmitting each site will try again after some random time interval  the main problem with this approach is that when the system is very  busy many collisions may occur and thus performance may be degraded  nevertheless csma cd has been used successfully in the ethernet system  the most common local area network system one strategy for limiting the  number of collisions is to limit the number of hosts per ethernet network  adding more hosts to a congested network could result in poor network  throughput as systems get faster they are able to send more packets per  time segment as a result the number of systems per ethernet network  generally is decreasing so that networking performance is kept reasonable  token passing a unique message type known as a continuously  circulates in the system usually a ring structure a site that wants to  transmit information must wait until the token arrives it then removes  the token from the ring and begins to transmit its messages when the  site completes its round of message passing it retransmits the token this  action in turn allows another site to receive and remove the token and  to start its message transmission if the token gets lost the system must  detect the loss and generate a new token it usually does that by declaring  an to choose a unique site where a new token will be generated  later in section we present one election algorithm a token passing  scheme has been adopted by the ibm and hp i apollo systems the benefit  of a token passing network is that performance is constant adding new  sites to a network may lengthen the waiting time for a token but it will not  cause a large performance decrease as may happen on ethernet on lightly  loaded networks however ethernet is more efficient because systems can  send messages at any time  when we are designing a communication network we must deal with the  inherent complexity of coordinating asynchronous operations communicating  in a potentially slow and error prone environment in addition the systems on  the network must agree on a protocol or a set of protocols for determining  host names locating hosts on the network establishing connections and  so on we can simplify the design problem and related implementation  by partitioning the problem into multiple layers each layer on one system  communicates with the equivalent layer on other systems typically each layer  has its own protocols and communication takes place between peer layers    network environment  iso environment  real systems environment  figure two computers communicating via the iso network model  using a specific protocol the protocols may be implemented in hardware or  software for instance figure shows the logical communications between  two computers with the three lowest level layers implemented in hardware  following the international standards organization iso we refer to the layers  as follows  physical layer the physical layer is responsible for handling both the  mechanical and the electrical details of the physical transmission of a bit  stream at the physical layer the communicating systems must agree on  the electrical representation of a binary and so that when data are  sent as a stream of electrical signals the receiver is able to interpret the  data properly as binary data this layer is implemented in the hardware  of the networking device  data link layer the data link layer is responsible for handlingfi ames or  fixed length parts of packets including any error detection and recovery  that occurs in the physical layer  network layer the network layer is responsible for providing connec\\xad tics and for routing packets in the communication network including  handling the addresses of outgoing packets decoding the addresses  of incoming packets and maintaining routing information for proper  response to changing load levels routers work at this layer  transport layer the transport layer is responsible for low level access  to the network and for transfer of messages between clients including  partitioning messages into packets maintaining packet order controlling  flow and generating physical addresses  session layer the session layer is responsible for implementing sessions  or process to process communication protocols typically these protocols  are the actual communications for remote logins and for file and mail  transfers   chapter  presentation layer the presentation layer is responsible for resolving the  differences in formats among the various sites in the network including  character conversions and half duplex full duplex modes character  echoing  application layer the application layer is responsible for interacting  directly with users this layer deals with file transfer remote login  protocols and electronic mail as well as with schemas for distributed  databases  figure summarizes the set of cooperating  protocols showing the physical flow of data as mentioned logically each  layer of a protocol stack communicates with the equivalent layer on other  systems but physically a message starts at or above the application layer and  end user application process  distributed information  transfer syntax negotiation  data representation transformations  dialog and synchronization  control for application entities  network independent  message interchange service j  end to end message transfer   connection management error control  fragmentation flow control  network routing addressing  call set up and clearing application layer  presentation layer  session layer  transport layer  network layer  data link control   framing data transparency error control link layer  mechanical and electrical  networkcinterface connections  physical connection to  network termination equipment physical layer  figure an iso network message  is passed through each lower level in turn each layer may modify the message  and il clude message header data for the equivalent layer on the receiving  side ultimately the message reaches the data network layer and is transferred  as one or more packets figure  the data lil k layer of the target system  receives these data and the message is moved up through the protocol stack  it is analyzed modified and stripped of headers as it progresses it fu ally  reaches the application layer for use by the receiving process  the iso model formalizes some of the earlier work done in network  protocols but was developed in the late s and is currently not in widespread  use perhaps the most widely adopted protocol stack is the tcp ip model which  has been adopted by virtually all internet sites the tcp ip protocol stack  has fewer layers than does the iso model theoretically because it combilles  several functions ill each layer it is more difficult to implement but more  efficient than iso networking the relationship between the iso and tcp ip  models is shown in figure the tcp ip application layer identifies several  protocols ill widespread use ill the internet illcluding http ftp telnet dns  and smtp the transport layer identifies the unreliable connectionless user  datagram protocol udp and the reliable connection oriented transmission  control protocol tcp the internet protocol ip is responsible for routing ip  datagrams through the internet the tcp ip model does not formally identify  a link or physical layer allowing tcp ip traffic to run across any physical  network in section we consider the tcp ip model running over an  ethernet network  security should be a concern in the design and implementation of any  modern communication protocol both strong authentication and encryption  are needed for secure communication strong authentication ensures that  the sender and receiver of a communication are who or what they are  supposed to be encryption protects the contents of the communication  from eavesdropping weak authentication and clear text communication are  still very common however for a variety of reasons when most of the   chapter   iso  presentation  session  physical tcp ip  http dns telnet  smtp ftp  not defined  not defined  tcp udp  not defined  not defined  figure the iso and tcp ip protocol stacks  common protocols were designed security was frequently less important than  performance simplicity and efficiency  strong authentication requires a multistep handshake protocol or authen\\xad tication devices adding complexity to a protocol modern cpus can efficiently  perform encryption and systems frequently offload encryption to separate  cryptography processors so system performance is not compromised long\\xad distance communication can be made secure by authenticating the endpoints  and encrypting the stream of packets in a virtual private network as discussed  in  lan communication remains unencrypted at most sites but proto\\xad cols such as nfs version which includes strong native authentication and  encryption should help improve even lan security  a distributed system may suffer from various types of hardware failure the  failure of a link the failure of a site and the loss of a message are the most  common types to ensure that the system is robust we must detect any of these  failures reconfigure the system so that computation can continue and recover  when a site or a link is repaired   failure detection  in an environment with no shared memory we are generally unable to  differentiate among link failure site failure and message loss we can usually  detect only that one of these failures has occurred once a failure has been    detected appropriate action must be taken what action is appropriate depends  on the particular application  to detect link and site failure we use a procedure suppose  that sites a and b have a direct physical link between them at fixed intervals  the sites send each other an j am up m essage if site a does not receive this  message within a predetermined time period it can assume that site b has  failed that the link between a and b has failed or that the message from b  has been lost at this point site a has two choices it can wait for another time  period to receive an j am up message from b or it can send an are you up  message to b  if time goes by and site a still has not received an j am up message or if site  a has sent an are you up message and has not received a reply the procedure  can be repeated again the only conclusion that site a can draw safely is that  some type of failure has occurred  site a can try to differentiate between link failure and site failure by sending  an are you up message to b by another route if one exists if and when b  receives this message it immediately replies positively this positive reply tells  a that b is up and that the failure is in the direct link between them since we  do not know in advance how long it will take the message to travel from a to b  and back we must use a at the time a sends the are you up  message it specifies a time interval during which it is willing to wait for the  reply from b if a receives the reply message within that time interval then it  can safely conclude that b is up if not however that is if a time out occurs  then a may conclude only that one or more of the following sihations has  occurred  site b is down  the direct link if one exists from a to b is down  the alternative path from a to b is down  the message has been lost  site a cannot however determine which of these events has occurred   reconfiguration  suppose that site a has discovered through the mechanism described in the  previous section that a failure has occurred it must then initiate a procedure  that will allow the system to reconfigure and to continue its normal mode of  operation  if a direct link from a to b has failed this information must be broadcast to  every site in the system so that the various routing tables can be updated  accordingly  if the system believes that a site has failed because that site can be reached  no longer then all sites in the system must be so notified so that they  will no longer attempt to use the services of the failed site the failure of a  site that serves as a central coordinator for some activity such as deadlock  detection requires the election of a new coordinator similarly if the failed   chapter  site is part of a logical ring then a new logical ring must be constructed  note that if the site has not failed that is if it is up but camwt be reached  then we may have the undesirable situation in which two sites serve as the  coordinator when the network is partitioned the two coordinators each  for its own partition may initiate conflicting actions for example if the  coordinators are responsible for implementing mutual exclusion we may  have a situation in which two processes are executing simultaneously in  their critical sections   recovery from failure  when a failed link or site is repaired it must be integrated into the system  gracefully and smoothly  suppose that a link between a and b has failed wlcen it is repaired  both a and b must be notified we can accomplish this notification by  continuously repeating the handshaking procedure described in section    suppose that site b has failed wlcen it recovers it must notify all other sites  that it is up again site b then may have to receive information from the  other sites to update its local tables for example it may need routing table  information a list of sites that are down or mcdelivered messages and  mail if the site has not failed but simply could not be reached then this  information is still required   fault tolerance  a distributed system must tolerate a certain level of failure and continue to  function normally when faced with various types of failures making a facility  fault tolerant starts at the protocol level as described above but continues  through all aspects of the system we use the term fault tolerance in a broad  sense communication faults machine failures of type fail stop where the  machine stops before performing an erroneous operation that is visible to other  processors storage device crashes and decays of storage media should all be  tolerated to some extent a should continue to function  perhaps in a degraded form when faced with such failures the degradation  can be in performance in functionality or in both it should be proportional  however to the failures that caused it a system that grinds to a halt when only  one of its components fails is certainly not fault tolerant  unfortunately fault tolerance can be difficult and expensive to implement  at the network layer multiple redundant communication paths and network  devices such as switches and routers are needed to avoid a cmnmunication  failure a storage failure can cause loss of the operating system applications  or data storage units can include redundant hardware components that  automatically take over from each other in case of failure in addition raid  systems can ensure continued access to the data even in the event of one or  more disk failures section   a system failure without redundancy can cause an application or an entire  facility to stop operation the inost simple system failure involves a system  running only stateless applications these applications can be restarted without     compromising the operation so as long as the applications can run on more  than one computer node operation can continue such a facility is commonly  known as a because it is computation centric  in contrast systems involve running applications that access  and modify shared data as a result data centric computing facilities are more  difficult to make fault tolerant they failure monitoring software and  special infrastructure for instance such as veritas  cluster and sun cluster include two or more computers and a set of shared  disks any given application can be stored on the computers or on the shared  disk but the data must be stored on the shared disk the running application s  node has exclusive access to the application s data on disk the application is  monitored by the cluster software and if it fails it is automatically restarted  if it camwt be restarted or if the entire computer fails the node s exclusive  access to the application s data is terminated and is granted to another node  in the cluster the application is restarted on that new node the application  loses whatever state information was in the failed system s memory but can  continue based on whatever state it last wrote to the shared disk from a user s  point of view a service was interrupted and then restarted possibly with some  data missing  specific applications may improve on this functionality by implementing  lock management along with clustering with lock management section    the application can run on multiple nodes and can use the same data  on shared disks concurrently clustered databases frequently implement this  functionality if anode fails transactions can continue on other nodes and users  notice no interruption of service as long as the client is able to automatically  locate the other nodes in the cluster any noncommitted transactions on the  failed node are lost but again client applications can be designed to retry  noncommitted transactions if they detect a failure of their database node  making the multiplicity of processors and storage devices to the  users has been a key challenge to many designers ideally a distributed system  should look to its users like a conventional centralized system the user  interface of a transparent distributed system should not distinguish between  local and remote resources that is users should be able to access remote  resources as though these resources were local and the distributed system  should be responsible for locating the resources and for arranging for the  appropriate interaction  another aspect of transparency is user mobility it would be convenient  to allow users to log into any machine in the system rather than forcing  them to use a specific machine a transparent distributed system facilitates  user mobility by bringiicg over the user s environment for example home  directory to wherever he logs in both the andrew file system from cmu and  project athena from mit provide this functionality on a large scale nfs can  provide it on a smaller scale  still another issue is l the capability of a system to adapt to  increased service load systems have bounded resources and can become  completely saturated under increased load for example with respect to a file   chapter  system saturation occurs either when a server s cpu runs at a high utilization  rate or when disks are almost full scalability is a relative property but it can be  measured accurately a scalable system reacts more gracefully to increased load  than does a nonscalable one first its performance degrades more moderately  and second its resources reach a saturated state later even perfect design  cannot accommodate an ever growing load adding new resources might solve  the problem but it might generate additional indirect load on other resources   for example adding machines to a distributed system can clog the network  and increase service loads even worse expanding the system can call for  expensive design modifications a scalable system should have the potential  to grow without these problems in a distributed system the ability to scale  up gracefully is of special importance since expanding the network by adding  new machines or interconnecting two networks is commonplace in short a  scalable design should withstand high service load accommodate growth of  the user community and enable simple integration of added resources  scalability is related to fault tolerance discussed earlier a heavily loaded  component can become paralyzed and behave like a faulty component also  shifting the load from a faulty component to that component s backup can  saturate the latter generally having spare resources is essential for ensuring  reliability as well as for handling peak loads gracefully an inherent advantage  of a distributed system is a potential for fault tolerance and scalability because  of the multiplicity of resources however inappropriate design can obscure  this potential fault tolerance and scalability considerations call for a design  demonstrating distribution of control and data  very large scale distributed systems to a great extent are still only  theoretical no magic guidelines ensure the scalability of a system it is easier  to point out why current designs are not scalable we next discuss several  designs that pose problems and propose possible solutions all in the context  of scalability  one principle for designing very large scale systems is that the service  demand from any component of the system should be bounded by a constant  that is independent of the number of nodes in the system any service  mechanism whose load demand is proportional to the size of the system is  destined to become clogged once the system grows beyond a certain size  adding more resources will not alleviate such a problem the capacity of this  mechanism simply limits the growth of the system  another principle concerns centralization central control schemes and  central resources should not be used to build scalable and fault tolerant  systems examples of centralized entities are central authentication servers  central naming servers and central file servers centralization is a form of  functional asyrrunetry among machines constituting the system the ideal  alternative is a functionally symmetric configuration that is all the component  machines have an equal role in the operation of the system and hence each  machine has some degree of autonomy practically it is virtually impossible to  comply with such a principle for instance incorporating diskless machines  violates functional symmetry since the workstations depend on a central disk  however autonomy and symmetry are important goals to which we should  aspire  deciding on the process structure of the server is a major problem in  the design of any service servers are supposed to operate efficiently in peak     periods when hundreds of active clients need to be served simultaneously a  single process server is certainly not a good choice since whenever a request  necessitates disk i the whole service will be blocked assigning a process for  each client is a better choice however the expense of frequent context switches  between the processes must be considered a related problem occurs because  all the server processes need to share information  one of the best solutions for the server architecture is the use of lightweight  processes or threads which we discuss in chapter we can think of a group  of lightweight processes as multiple threads of control associated with some  shared resources usually a lightweight process is not bound to a particular  client instead it serves single requests of different clients scheduling of  threads can be preemptive or nonpreemptive if threads are allowed to run  to completion nonpreemptive then their shared data do not need to be  protected explicitly otherwise some explicit locking mechanism must be used  clearly some form of lightweight process scheme is essential if servers are to  be scalable  we now return to the name resolution issue raised in section and  examine its operation with respect to the tcf if protocol stack on the internet  we consider the processing needed to transfer a packet between hosts on  different ethernet networks  in a tcf if network every host has a name and an associated if address   or host id both of these strings must be unique and so that the name space  can be managed they are segmented the name is hierarchical as explained  in section  describing the host name and then the organization with  which the host is associated the host id is split into a network number and a  host number the proportion of the split varies depending on the size of the  network once the internet adrninistrators assign a network number the site  with that number is free to assign host ids  the sending system checks its routing tables to locate a router to send the  frame on its way the routers use the network part of the host id to transfer  the packet from its source network to the destination network the destination  system then receives the packet the packet may be a complete message or it  may just be a component of a message with more packets needed before the  message can be reassembled and passed to the tcf udf layer for transmission  to the destination process  now we know how a packet moves from its source network to its  destination within a network how does a packet move from sender host  or router to receiver ethernet device has a unique byte number called  the assigned to it for addressing two  devices on a lan communicate with each other only with this number if  a system needs to send data to another system the networking software  generates an containing the if  address of the destination system this packet is to all other systems  on that ethernet network  a broadcast uses a special network address usually the maximum  address to signal that all hosts should receive and process the packet the   chapter  broadcast is not re sent by gateways so only systems on the local network  receive it only the system whose ip address matches the ip address of the arp  request responds and sends back its mac address to the system that initiated  the query for efficiency the host caches the ip mac address pair in an internal  table the cache entries are so that an entry is eventually removed from  the cache if an access to that system is not required within a given time in  this way hosts that are removed from a network are eventually forgotten for  added performance arp entries for heavily used hosts may be hardwired in  the arp cache  once an ethernet device has announced its host id and address commu\\xad nication can begin a process may specify the name of a host with which to  communicate networking software takes that name and determines the ip  address of the target using a dns lookup the message is passed from the  application layer through the software layers and to the hardware layer at  the hardware layer the packet or packets has the ethernet address at its start  a trailer indicates the end of the packet and contains a for detection  of packet damage figure  the packet is placed on the network by the  ethernet device the data section of the packet may contain some or all of the  data of the original message but it may also contain some of the upper level  headers that compose the message in other words all parts of the original  message must be sent from source to destination and all headers above the   layer data link layer are included as data in the ethernet packets  if the destination is on the same local network as the source the system  can look in its arp cache find the ethernet address of the host and place the  packet on the wire the destination ethernet device then sees its address in the  packet and reads in the packet passing it up the protocol stack  if the destination system is on a network different from that of the source  the source system finds an appropriate router on its network and sends the  packet there routers then pass the packet along the wan mtil it reaches its  bytes destination network the router that connects the destination network checks  its arp cache finds the ethernet number of the destination and sends the  packet to that host through all of these transfers the data link layer header  may change as the ethernet address of the next router in the chain is used but  the other headers of the packet remain the same until the packet is received  and processed by the protocol stack and finally passed to the receiving process  by the kernel  a distributed system is a collection of processors that do not share memory or  a clock instead each processor has its own local memory and the processors  communicate with one another through various communication lines such  as high speed buses and telephone lines the processors in a distributed  system vary in size and function they may include small microprocessors  workstations minicomputers and large general purpose computer systems  the processors in the system are connected through a communication  network which can be configured in a number of ways the network may  be fully or partially connected it may be a tree a star a ring or a multiaccess  bus

resources  the system provides access to a shared resource can be provided by data  migration computation migration or process migration  protocol stacks as specified by network layering models massage the  message adding information to it to ensure that it reaches its destination a  naming system such as dns must be used to translate from a host name  to a network address and another protocol such as arp may be needed  to translate the network number to a network device address an ethernet  address for instance if systems are located on separate networks routers are  needed to

 issues relating to a distributed virtual machine for distributed systems  are examined in sirer et al    in the previous chapter we discussed network construction and the low level  protocols needed to transfer between systems now we examine  one use of this infrastructure a is a distributed  implementation of the classical time sharing of a file system where  multiple users share files and storage resources chapter the purpose of  a dfs is to support the same kind of sharing when the files are physically  dispersed among the sites of a distributed system  in this chapter we describe how a dfs can be designed and implemented  first we discuss common concepts on which dfss are based then we illustrate  our concepts by examining one influential dfs the andrew file system afs  to explain the naming mechanism that provides location transparency and  independence  to describe the various methods for accessing distributed files  to contrast stateful and stateless distributed file servers  to show how replication of files on different machines in a distributed file  system is a useful redundancy for improving availability  to introduce the andrew file system afs as an example of a distributed  file system  as we noted in the preceding chapter a distributed system is a collection  of loosely coupled computers interconnected by a communication network  these computers can share physically dispersed files by using a distributed  file system dfs in this chapter we use the term dfs to mean distributed file  systems in general not the commercial transarc dfs product we refer to the  latter as transarc dfs also nfs refers to nfs version unless otherwise noted     chapter  to explain the structure of a dfs we need to define the terms service server  and client a is a software entity running on one or more machines  and providing a particular type of function to clients a is the service  software running on a single machine a is a process that can invoke  a service using a set of operations that form its sometimes a  lower level interface is defined for the actual cross machine interaction it is  the  using this terminology we say that a file system provides file services to  clients a client interface for a file service is formed by a set of primitive file  operations such as create a file delete a file read from a file and write to a file  the primary hardware concponent that a file server controls is a set of local  secondary storage devices usually magnetic disks on which files are stored  and from which they are retrieved according to the clients requests  a dfs is a file system whose clients servers and storage devices are  dispersed among the machines of a distributed system accordingly service  activity has to be carried out across the network instead of a single centralized  data repository the system frequently has multiple and independent storage  devices as you will see the concrete configuration and implementation of a  dfs may vary from system to system in some configurations servers run on  dedicated machines in others a machine can be both a server and a client a dfs  can be implemented as part of a distributed operating system or alternatively  by a software layer whose task is to manage the communication between  conventional operating systems and file systems the distinctive features of a  dfs are the multiplicity and autonomy of clients and servers in the system  ideally a dfs should appear to its clients to be a conventional centralized  file system the multiplicity and dispersion of its servers and storage devices  should be made invisible that is the client interface of a dfs should not  distinguish between local and remote files it is up to the dfs to locate the  files and to arrange for the transport of the data a dfs facilitates  user mobility by bringing a user s environment that is home directory to  wherever the user logs in  the most important performance measure of a dfs is the amount of time  needed to satisfy service requests in conventional systems this time consists of  disk access time and a small amount of cpu processing time in a dfs however  a remote access has the additional overhead attributed to the distributed  structure this overhead includes the time to deliver the request to a server as  well as the time to get the response across the network back to the client for  each direction in addition to the transfer of the information there is the cpu  overhead of running the communication protocol software the performance  of a dfs can be viewed as another dimension of the dfs s transparency that is  the performance of an ideal dfs would be comparable to that of a conventional  file system  the fact that a dfs manages a set of dispersed storage devices is the dfs s  key distinguishing feature the overall storage space managed by a dfs is  composed of different and remotely located smaller storage spaces usually  these constituent storage spaces correspond to sets of files a cmnpm c nt  is the smallest set of files that can be stored on a single machine independently  from other units all files belonging to the same component unit must reside  in the same location     is a mapping between logical and physical objects for instance  users deal with logical data objects represented by file nances whereas the  system manipulates physical blocks of data stored on disk tracks usually a  user refers to a file by a textual name the latter is mapped to a lower level  numerical identifier that in turn is mapped to disk blocks this multilevel  mapping provides users with an abstraction of a file that hides the details of  how and where on the disk the file is stored  in a transparent dfs a new dimension is added to the abstraction that of  hiding where in the network the file is located in a conventional file system the  range of the naming mapping is an address within a disk in a dfs this range  is expanded to include the specific machine on whose disk the file is stored  going one step further with the concept of treating files as abstractions leads  to the possibility of given a file name the mapping returns a  set of the locations of this file s replicas in this abstraction both the existence  of multiple copies and their locations are hidden   naming structures  we need to differentiate two related notions regarding name mappings in a  dfs   the name of a file does not reveal any hint of the  file s physical storage location  the name of a file does not need to be changed  when the file s physical storage location changes  both definitions relate to the level of naming discussed previously  since files have different names at different levels that is user level textual  names and system level numerical identifiers a location independent nam\\xad ing scheme is a dynamic mapping since it can map the same file name to  different locations at two different times therefore location independence is  a stronger property than is location transparency  in practice most of the current dfss provide a static location transparent  mapping for user level names these systems however do not support  · that is changing the location of a file automatically is impossible  hence the notion of location independence is irrelevant for these systems  files are associated permanently with a specific set of disk blocks files and  disks can be moved between machines manually but file migration implies an  automatic operating system initiated action only afs and a few experimental  file systems support location independence and file mobility afs supports file  mobility mainly for administrative purposes a protocol provides migration  of afs component units to satisfy high level user requests without changing  either the user level names or the low level names of the corresponding files  a few aspects can further differentiate location independence and static  location transparency  divorce of data from location as exhibited by location independence  provides a better abstraction for files a file name should denote the file s   chapter  most significant attributes which are its contents ratber than its location  location independent files can be viewed as logical data containers that  are not attached to a specific storage location if only static location  transparency is supported the file name still denotes a specific although  hidden set of physical disk blocks  static location transparency provides users with a convenient way to share  data users can share remote files by simply naming the files in a location\\xad transparent manner as though the files were local nevertheless sharing  the storage space is cumbersome because logical names are still statically  attached to physical storage devices location independence promotes  sharing the storage space itself as well as the data objects when files can  be mobilized the overall system wide storage space looks like a single  virtual resource a possible benefit of such a view is the ability to balance  the utilization of disks across the system  location independence separates the naming hierarchy from the storage\\xad devices hierarchy and from the intercomputer structure by contrast if  static location transparency is used although names are transparent  we can easily expose the correspondence between component units and  machines the machines are configured in a pattern similar to the naming  structure this configuration may restrict the architecture of the system  um ecessarily and conflict with other considerations a server in charge of  a root directory is an example of a structure that is dictated by the naming  hierarchy and contradicts decentralization guidelines  once the separation of name and location has been completed clients  can access files residing on remote server systems in fact these clients may  be and rely on servers to provide all files including the operating\\xad system kernel special protocols are needed for the boot sequence however  consider the problem of getting the kernel to a diskless workstation the  diskless workstation has no kernel so it cam ot use the dfs code to retrieve  the kernel instead a special boot protocol stored in read only memory rom  on the client is invoked it enables networking and retrieves only one special  file the kernel or boot code from a fixed location once the kernel is copied  over the network and loaded its dfs makes all the other operating system files  available the advantages of diskless clients are many including lower cost   because the client machines require no disks and greater convenience when  an operating system upgrade occurs only the server needs to be modified  the disadvantages are the added complexity of the boot protocols and the  performance loss resulting from the use of a network rather than a local disk  the current trend is for clients to use both local disks and remote file servers  operating systems and networking software are stored locally file systems  containing user data and possibly applications are stored on remote file  systems some client systems may store commonly used applications such as  word processors and web browsers on the local file system as well other less  commonly used applications may be from the remote file server to the  client on demand the main reason for providing clients with local file systems  rather than pure diskless systems is that disk drives are rapidly increasing in  capacity and decreasing in cost with new generations appearing every year  or so the same cannot be said for networks which evolve every few years    overall systems are growing more quickly than are networks so extra work  is needed to limit network access to improve system throughput   naming schemes  there are three main approaches to naming schemes in a dfs in the simplest  approach a file is identified by some combination of its host name and local  name which guarantees a unique system wide name in ibis for instance  a file is identified uniquely by the name host local name where local name is a  unix like path this naming scheme is neither location transparent nor location  independent nevertheless the same file operations can be used for both local  and remote files the dfs is structured as a collection of isolated component  units each of which is an entire conventional file system in this first approach  component mits remain isolated although means are provided to refer to a  remote file we do not consider this scheme any further in this text  the second approach was popularized by sun s network file system nfs  nfs is the file system component of onc a networking package supported  by many unix vendors nfs provides a means to attach remote directories  to local directories thus giving the appearance of a coherent directory tree  early nfs versions allowed only previously mmmted remote directories to  be accessed transparently with the advent of the feature mounts  are done on demand based on a table of mount points and file structure  names components are integrated to support transparent sharing although  this integration is limited and is not uniform because each machine may attach  different remote directories to its tree the resulting structure is versatile  we can achieve total integration of the component file systems by using the  third approach here a single global name structure spans all the files in the  system ideally the composed file system structure is the same as the structure  of a conventional file system in practice however the many special files for  example unix device files and machine specific binary directories make this  goal difficult to attain  to evaluate naming structures we look at their  the most complex and most difficult to maintain structure is the nfs structure  because any rem ote directory can be attached anywhere onto the local directory  tree the resulting hierarchy can be highly mstructured if a server becomes  unavailable some arbitrary set of directories on different machines becomes  unavailable in addition a separate accreditation mechanism controls which  machine is allowed to attach which directory to its tree thus a user might  be able to access a remote directory tree on one client but be denied access on  another client   implementation techniques  implementation of transparent naming requires a provision for the mapping  of a file naine to the associated location to keep this mapping manageable  we must aggregate sets of files into component units and provide the mapping  on a component unit basis rather than on a single file basis this aggregation  serves administrative purposes as well unix like systems use the hierarchical  directory tree to provide name to location mapping and to aggregate files  recursively into directories   chapter   to enhance the availability of the crucial mapping information we can use  replication local caching or both as we noted location independence means  that the mapping changes over time hence replicating the mapping makes  a simple yet consistent update of this information impossible a teclllcique  to overcome this obstacle is to introduce low level me  textual file names are mapped to lower level file identifiers that  indicate to which component unit the file belongs these identifiers are still  location independent they can be replicated and cached freely without being  invalidated by migration of component units the inevitable price is the need  for a second level of mapping which maps component units to locations and  needs a simple yet consistent update mechanism implementing unix like  directory trees using these low levet location independent identifiers makes  the whole hierarchy invariant under component unit migration the only  aspect that does change is the component unit location mapping  a common way to implement low level identifiers is to use structured  names these names are bit strings that usually have two parts the first  part identifies the component unit to which the file belongs the second part  identifies the particular file within the unit variants with more parts are  possible the invariant of structured names however is that individual parts  of the name are unique at all times only within the context of the rest of the  parts we can obtain uniqueness at all times by taking care not to reuse a name  that is still in use by adding sufficiently more bits this method is used in afs  or by using a timestamp as one part of the name as done in apollo domain  another way to view this process is that we are taking a location transparent  system such as ibis and adding another level of abstraction to produce a  location independent naming scheme  aggregating files into component units and using lower level location\\xad independent file identifiers are techniques exemplified in afs  consider a user who requests access to a remote file the server storing the file  has been located by the nanling scheme and now the actual data transfer must  take place  one way to achieve this transfer is through a  whereby requests for accesses are delivered to the server the server machine  performs the accesses and their results are forwarded back to the user one  of the most common ways of implementing remote service is the remote  procedure call rpc paradigm which we discussed in chapter a direct  analogy exists between disk access methods in conventional file systems and  the remote service method in a dfs using the remote service method is  analogous to performing a disk access for each access request  to ensure reasonable performance of a remote service mechanism we can  use a form of caching in conventional file systems the rationale for caching is  to reduce disk i thereby increasing performance whereas in dfss the goal  is to reduce both network traffic and disk i in the following discussion we  describe the implementation of caching in a dfs and contrast it with the basic  remote service paradigm     basic caching scheme  the concept of caching is simple if the data needed to satisfy the access request  are not already cached then a copy of those data is brought from the server to  the client system accesses are performed on the cached copy the idea is to  retain recently accessed disk blocks in the cache so that repeated accesses to the  same information can be handled locally without additional network traffic  a replacement policy for example the least recently used algorithm keeps  the cache size bounded no direct correspondence exists between accesses and  traffic to the server files are still identified with one master copy residing at the  server machine but copies or parts of the file are scattered in different caches  when a cached copy is modified the changes need to be reflected on the master  copy to preserve the relevant consistency semantics the problem of keeping  the cached copies consistent with the master file is the  which we discuss in section  dfs caching could just as easily  be called it acts sincilarly to demand paged virtual  memory except that the backing store usually is not a local disk but rather a  remote server nfs allows the swap space to be mounted remotely so it actually  can implement virtual memory over a network notwithstanding the resulting  performance penalty  the granularity of the cached data in a dfs can vary from blocks of a file to  an entire file usually more data are cached than are needed to satisfy a single  access so that many accesses can be served by the cached data this procedure  is much like diskread ahead section  afs caches files in large chunks  kb the other systems discussed in this chapter support caching of individual  blocks driven by client demand increasing the caching unit increases the hit  ratio but it also increases the miss penalty because each miss requires more  data to be transferred it increases the potential for consistency problems as  well selecting the unit of caching involves considering parameters such as the  network transfer unit and the rpc protocol service unit if an rpc protocol is  used the network transfer unit for ethernet a packet is about kb so larger  units of cached data need to be disassembled for delivery and reassembled on  reception  block size and total cache size are obviously of importance for block\\xad caching schemes in unix like systems common block sizes are kb and  kb for large caches over mb large block sizes over kb are beneficial for  smaller caches large block sizes are less beneficial because they result in fewer  blocks in the cache and a lower hit ratio   cache location  where should the cached data be stored on disk or in main memory disk  caches have one clear advantage over main memory caches they are reliable  modifications to cached data are lost in a crash if the cache is kept in volatile  memory moreover if the cached data are kept on disk they are still there during  recovery and there is no need to fetch them again main memory caches have  several advantages of their own however  main memory caches permit workstations to be diskless  data can be accessed more quickly from a cache in main memory than  from one on a disk   chapter  technology is moving toward larger and less expensive memory the  resulting performance speedup is predicted to outweigh the advantages  of disk caches  the server caches used to speed up disk i will be in main memory  regardless of where user caches are located if we use main memory caches  on the user machine too we can build a single caching nl echanism for use  by both servers and users  many remote access implementations can be thought of as hybrids of  caching and remote service in nfs for instance the implementation is based on  remote service but is augmented with client and server side memory caching  for performance similarly sprite s implementation is based on caching but  under certain circumstances a remote service method is adopted thus to  evaluate the two methods we must evaluate the degree to which either method  is emphasized  the nfs protocol and most implementations do not provide disk caching  recent solaris implementations ofnfs solaris and beyond include a client\\xad side disk caching option the file system once the nfs client reads  blocks of a file from the server it caches them in memory as well as on disk  if the memory copy is flushed or even if the system reboots the disk cache  is referenced if a needed block is neither in memory nor in the cachefs disk  cache an rpc is sent to the server to retrieve the block and the block is written  into the disk cache as well as stored in the memory cache for client use   cache update policy  the policy used to write modified data blocks back to the server s master copy  has a critical effect on the performance and reliability the simplest  policy is to write data to disk as soon as they are placed in any cache  the advantage of a is reliability little information is  lost when a client system crashes however this policy requires each write  access to wait until the information is sent to the server so it causes poor write  performance caching with write through is equivalent to using remote service  for write accesses and exploiting caching for read accesses  an alternative is the also known as  where we delay updates to the master copy modifications are written  to the cache and then are written through to the server at a later time this  policy has two advantages over write through first because writes are made  to the cache write accesses complete much more quickly second data may  be overwritten before they are written back in which case only the last update  needs to be written at all unfortunately delayed write schemes introduce  reliability problems since unwritten data are lost whenever a user machine  crashes  variations of the delayed write policy differ in when modified data blocks  are flushed to the server one alternative is to flush a block when it is about to  be ejected from the client s cache this option can result in good performance  but some blocks can reside in the client s cache a long time before they are  written back to the server a compromise between this alternative and the  write through policy is to scan the cache at regular intervals and to flush  blocks that have been modified since the most recent scan just as unix scans    nfs server  network workstation  figure cachefs and its use of caching  its local cache sprite uses this policy with a second interval nfs uses the  policy for file data but once a write is issued to the server durilcg a cache  flush the write must reach the server s disk before it is considered complete  nfs treats meta data directory data and file attribute data differently any  metadata changes are issued synchronously to the server thus file structure  loss and directory structure corruption are avoided when a client or the server  crashes  for nfs with cachefs writes are also written to the local disk cache area  when they are written to the server to keep all copies consistent thus nfs  with cachefs improves performance over standard nfs on a read request with  a cachefs cache hit but decreases performance for read or write requests with  a cache miss as with all caches it is vital to have a high cache hit rate to  gain performance figure shows how cachefs uses write through and  write back caching  yet another variation on delayed write is to write data back to the server  when the file is closed this is used in afs in the case  of files that are open for short periods or are modified rarely this policy  does not significantly reduce network traffic in addition the write on close  policy requires the closing process to delay while the file is written through  which reduces the performance advantages of delayed writes for files that are  open for long periods and are modified frequently however the performance  advantages of this policy over delayed write with more frequent flushing are  apparent   consistency  a client machine is faced with the problem of deciding whether a locally cached  copy of the data is consistent with the master copy and hence can be used if   chapter  the client machine determines that its cached data are out of date accesses can  no longer be served by those cached data an up to date copy of the data needs  to be cached there are two approaches to verifying the validity of cached data  client initiated approach the client initiates a validity check in which it  contacts the server and checks whether the local data are consistent with  the master copy the frequency of the validity checking is the crux of  this approach and determines the resulting consistency semantics it can  range from a check before every access to a check only on first access to  a file on file open basically every access coupled with a validity check  is delayed compared with an access served immediately by the cache  alternatively checks can be initiated at fixed time intervals depending  on its frequency the validity check can load both the network and the  server  server initiated approach the server records for each client the files   or parts of files that it caches when the server detects a potential  inconsistency it must react a potential for inconsistency occurs when  two different clients in conflicting modes cache a file if unix semantics   section  is implemented we can resolve the potential inconsistency  by having the server play an active role the server must be notified  whenever a file is opened and the intended mode read or write must  be indicated for every open the server can then act when it detects that  a file has been opened simultaneously in conflicting modes by disabling  caching for that particular file actually disabling caching results in  switching to a remote service mode of operation   a comparison of caching and remote service  essentially the choice between caching and remote service trades off poten\\xad tially increased performance with decreased simplicity we evaluate this  tradeoff by listing the advantages and disadvantages of the two methods  when caching is used the local cache can handle a substantial number  of the remote accesses efficiently capitalizing on locality in file access  patterns makes caching even more attractive thus most of the remote  accesses will be served as fast as will local ones moreover servers are  contacted only occasionally rather than for each access consequently  server load and network traffic are reduced and the potential for scalability  is enhanced by contrast when the remote service method is used every  remote access is handled across the network the penalty in network traffic  server load and performance is obvious  total network overhead is lower for transmitting big chunks of data as  is done in caching than for transmitting series of responses to specific  requests as in the remote service method furthermore disk access  routines on the server may be better optimized if it is known that requests  will always be for large contiguous segments of data rather than for  random disk blocks  the cache consistency problem is the major drawback of caching when  access patterns exhibit infrequent writes caching is superior however     when writes are frequent the mechanisms employed to overcome the  consistency problem incur substantial overhead in terms of performance  network traffic and server load  so that caching will confer a benefit execution should be carried out on  machines that have either local disks or large main memories remote  access on diskless small memory capacity machines should be done  through the remote service method  in caching since data are transferred en masse between the server and the  client rather than in response to the specific needs of a file operation the  lower level intermachine interface is different from the upper level user  interface the remote service paradigm in contrast is just an extension of  the local file system interface across the network thus the intermachine  interface mirrors the user interface  there are two approaches for storing server side information when a client  accesses remote files either the server tracks each file being accessed by each  client or it simply provides blocks as they are requested by the client without  knowledge of how those blocks are used in the former case the service  provided is stateful in the latter case it is stateless  the typical scenario involving a is as follows a client  must perform an open operation on a file before accessing that file the server  fetches information about the file from its disk stores it in its memory and gives  the client a connection identifier that is unique to the client and the open file   in unix terms the server fetches the inode and gives the client a file descriptor  which serves as an index to an in core table of inodes this identifier is used for  subsequent accesses ru til the session ends a stateful service is characterized  as a connection between the client and the server during a session either on  closing the file or through a garbage collection mechanism the server must  reclaim the main memory space used by clients that are no longer active the  key point regarding fault tolerance in a stateful service approach is that the  server keeps main memory information about its clients afs is a stateful file  service  a avoids state information by making each request  self contained that is each request identifies the file and the position in the  file for read and write accesses in full the server does not need to keep a  table of open files in main memory although it usually does so for efficiency  reasons moreover there is no need to establish and terminate a com ection  through open and close operations they are totally redundant since  each file operation stands on its own and is not considered part of a session a  client process would open a file and that open would not result in the sending  of a remote message reads and writes would take place as remote messages   or cache lookups the final close by the client would again result in only a  local operation nfs is a stateless file service  the advantage of a stateful over a stateless service is increased perfor\\xad mance file information is cached in main memory and can be accessed easily  via the connection identifier thereby saving disk accesses in addition a stateful   chapter   server knows whether a file is open for sequential access and can therefore  read ahead the next blocks stateless servers cmmot do so since they have no  knowledge of the purpose of the client s requests  the distinction between stateful and stateless service becomes more  evident when we consider the effects of a crash that occurs during a service  activity a stateful server loses all its volatile state in a crash ensuring the  graceful recovery of such a server involves restoring this state usually by a  recovery protocol based on a dialog with clients less graceful recovery requires  that the operations that were underway when the crash occurred be aborted  a different problem is caused by client failures the server needs to become  aware of such failures so that it can reclaim space allocated to record the state of  crashed client processes this phenomenon is sometimes referred to as  a stateless computer server avoids these problems silcce a newly reincar\\xad nated server can respond to a self contained request without any difficulty  therefore the effects of server failures and recovery are almost unnoticeable  there is no difference between a slow server and a recovering server from a  client s point of view the client keeps retransmitting its request if it receives  no response  the penalty for using the robust stateless service is longer request messages  and slower processing of requests since there is no in core i lformation to speed  the processing in addition stateless service imposes additional constraints  on the design of the dfs first since each request identifies the target file a  uniform system wide low level naming scheme should be used translating  remote to local names for each request would cause even slower processing  of the requests second since clients retransmit requests for file operations  these operations must be idempotent that is each operation must have the  same effect and return the same output if executed several times consecutively  self contained read and write accesses are idempotent as long as they use an  absolute byte count to indicate the position withilc the file they access and do  not rely on an incremental offset as is done in unix read and write  system calls however we must be careful when implementing destructive  operations such as deleting a file to make them idempotent too  in some environments a stateful service is a necessity if the server employs  the server initiated method for cache validation it camcot provide stateless  service since it maintains a record of which files are cached by which clients  the way unix uses file descriptors and implicit offsets is inherently stateful  servers must mailctain tables to map the file descriptors to inodes and must  store the current offset within a file this requirement is why nfs which  employs a stateless service does not use file descriptors and does include  an explicit offset in every access  replication of files on different machines in a distributed file system is a useful  redundancy for improving availability multimachine replication can benefit  performance too selecting a nearby replica to serve an access request results  in shorter service time   chapter   the main problem associated with replicas is updating from a user s  point of view replicas of a file denote the same logical entity and thus an  update to any replica must be reflected on all other replicas more precisely  the relevant consistency senantics must be preserved when accesses to replicas  are viewed as virtual accesses to the replicas logical files if consistency is not  of primary incportance it can be sacrificed for availability and performance in  this fundamental tradeoff in the area of fault tolerance the choice is between  preserving consistency at all costs thereby creating a potential for indefinite  blocking and sacrificing consistency under some we hope rare circumstances  for the sake of guaranteed progress locus for example employs replication  extensively and sacrifices consistency in the case of network partition for the  sake of availability of files for read and write accesses  ibis uses a variation of the primary copy approach the domain of the  name mapping is a pair primary replica identifier local replica identifier if no  local replica exists a special value is used thus the mapping is relative to a  machine if the local replica is the primary one the pair contains two identical  identifiers ibis supports demand replication an automatic replication control  policy similar to whole file caching under demand replication reading of  a nonlocal replica causes it to be cached locally thereby generating a new  nonprimary replica updates are performed only on the primary copy and  cause all other replicas to be invalidated through the sending of appropriate  messages atomic and serialized invalidation of all nonprimary replicas is not  guaranteed hence a stale replica may be considered valid to satisfy remote  write accesses we migrate the primary copy to the requesting machine  andrew is a distributed computing environment designed and implemented  at carnegie mellon university the andrew file system afs constitutes the  underlying information sharing mechanism among clients of the environment  the transarc corporation took over development of afs and then was pur\\xad chased by ibm ibm has since produced several commercial implementations  of afs afs was subsequently chosen as the dfs for an industry coalition the  result was part of the distributed computing environment dce  from the osf organization  in ibm s transarc lab announced that afs would be an open source  product termed openafs available under the ibm public license and transarc  dfs was canceled as a commercial product openafs is available under most  commercial versions of unix as well as linux and microsoft windows systems  many unix vendors as well as microsoft support the dce system and its dfs  which is based on afs and work is ongoing to make dce a cross platform  universally accepted dfs as afs and transarc dfs are very similar we describe  afs throughout this section unless transarc dfs is named specifically  afs seeks to solve many of the problems of the simpler dfss such as  nfs and is arguably the most feature rich nonexperimental dfs it features  a uniform name space location independent file sharing client side caching  with cache consistency and secure authentication via kerberos it also includes  server side caching in the form of replicas with high availability through  automatic switchover to a replica if the source server is unavailable one of the    most formidable attributes of afs is scalability the andrew system is targeted  to span over workstations between afs and transarc dfs there are  hundreds of implementations worldwide   overview  afs distinguishes between client machines sometimes referred to as worksta\\xad tions and dedicated server machines servers and clients originally ran only  bsd unix but afs has been ported to many operating systems the clients and  servers are interconnected by a network of lans or wans  clients are presented with a partitioned space of file names a  and a dedicated servers collectively called vice  after the name of the software they run present the shared name space to the  clients as a homogeneous identical and location transparent file hierarchy  the local name space is the root file system of a workstation from which  the shared name space descends workstations run the virtue protocol to  communicate with vice and each is required to have a local disk where it  stores its local name space servers collectively are responsible for the storage  and management of the shared name space the local name space is small  is distinct for each workstation and contains system programs essential for  autonomous operation and better performance also local are temporary files  and files that the workstation owner for privacy reasons explicitly wants to  store locally  viewed at a finer granularity clients and servers are structured in clusters  interconnected by a wan each cluster consists of a collection of workstations  on a lan and a representative of vice called a and each cluster  is com ected to the wan by a router the decomposition into clusters is  done primarily to address the problem of scale for optimal performance  workstations should use the server on their own cluster most of the time  thereby making cross cluster file references relatively infrequent  the file system architecture is also based on considerations of scale the  basic heuristic is to offload work from the servers to the clients in light  of experience indicating that server cpu speed is the system s bottleneck  following this heuristic the key mechanism for remote file operations is to  cache files in large chunks kb this feature reduces file open latency and  allows reads and writes to be directed to the cached copy without frequently  involving the servers  briefly here are a few additional issues in the design of afs  client mobility clients are able to access any file in the shared name  space from any workstation a client may notice some initial performance  degradation due to the caching of files when accessil g files a  workstation other than the usual one  security the vice interface is considered the boundary of trustworthiness  because no client programs are executed on vice machines authentication  and secure transmission functions are provided as part of a connection\\xad based communication package based on the rpc paradigm after mutual  authentication a vice server and a client communicate via encrypted  messages encryption is performed by hardware devices or more slowly   chapter  in software information about clients and groups is stored in a protection  database replicated at each server  protection afs provides for protecting directories and the  regular unlxbits for file protection the access list ncay contain information  about those users allowed to access a directory as well as information  about those users not allowed to access it thus it is simple to specify that  everyone except say jim can access a directory afs supports the access  types read write lookup insert administer lock and delete  heterogeneity defining a clear interface to vice is a key for integration of  diverse workstation hardware and operating systems so that heterogene\\xad ity is facilitated some files in the local bin directory are symbolic links  pointing to machine specific executable files residing in vice   the shared name space  afs s shared name space is made up of component units called the  volumes are unusually small component units typically they are associated  with the files of a single client few volumes reside within a single disk  partition and they may grow up to a quota and shrink in size conceptually  volumes are glued together by a mechanism similar to the unix mmt  mechanism however the granularity difference is significant since in unix  only an entire disk partition containing a file system can be mounted volumes  are a key administrative unit and play a vital role in identifying and locating  an individual file  a vice file or directory is identified by a low level identifier called a fid  each afs directory entry maps a path name component to a fid a fid is bits  long and has three equal length components a volume number a vnode number  and a uniquifier the vnode number is used as an index into an array containing  the inodes of files in a single volume the allows reuse of vnode  numbers thereby keeping certain data structures compact fids are location  transparent therefore file movements from server to server do not invalidate  cached directory contents  location information is kept on a volume basis in a  replicated on each server a client can identify the location of every  volume in the system by querying this database the aggregation of files into  volumes makes it possible to keep the location database at a manageable size  to balance the available disk space and utilization of servers volumes  need to be migrated among disk partitions and servers when a volume is  shipped to its new location its original server is left with temporary forwarding  information so that the location database need not be updated synchronously  while the volume is being transferred the original server can still handle  updates which are shipped later to the new server at some point the volume  is briefly disabled so that the recent modifications can be processed then the  new volume becomes available again at the new site the volume movement  operation is atomic if either server crashes the operation is aborted  read only replication at the granularity of an entire volume is supported  for system executable files and for seldom updated files in the upper levels  of the vice name space the volume location database specifies the server    contammg the only read write copy of a volume and a list of read only  replication sites   file operations and consistency semantics  the fundamental architectural principle in afs is the caching of entire files  from servers accordingly a client workstation interacts with vice servers  only during opening and closing of files and even this interaction is not  always necessary reading and writing files do not cause remote interaction in  contrast to the remote service n lethod this key distinction has far reaching  ramifications for performance as well as for semantics of file operations  the operating system on each workstation intercepts file system calls and  forwards them to a client level process on that workstation this process called  venus caches files from vice when they are opened and stores modified copies  of files back on the servers from which they came when they are closed venus  may contact vice only when a file is opened or closed reading and writing of  individual bytes of a file are performed directly on the cached copy and bypass  venus as a result writes at some sites are not visible immediately at other  sites  caching is further exploited for future opens of the cached file venus  assumes that cached entries files or directories are valid unless notified  otherwise therefore venus does not need to contact vice on a file open to  validate the cached copy the mechanism to support this policy called callback  dramatically reduces the number of cache validation requests received by  servers it works as follows when a client caches a file or a directory the  server updates its state information to record this caching we say that the  client has a callback on that file the server notifies the client before allowing  another client to modify the file in such a case we say that the server removes  the callback on the file for the former client a client can use a cached file for  open purposes only when the file has a callback if a client closes a file after  modifying it all other clients caching this file lose their callbacks therefore  when these clients open the file later they have to get the new version from  the server  readin g and writing bytes of a file are done directly by the kernel without  venus s intervention on the cached copy venus regains control when the file is  closed if the file has been modified locally it updates the file on the appropriate  server thus the only occasions on which venus contacts vice servers are on  opens of files that either are not in the cache or have had their callback revoked  and on closes of locally modified files  basically afs implements session semantics the only exceptions are  file operations other than the primitive read and write such as protection  changes at the directory level which are visible everywhere on the network  immediately after the operation completes  in spite of the callback mechanism a small amount of cached validation  traffic is still present usually to replace callbacks lost because of machine or  network failures when a workstation is rebooted venus considers all cached  files and directories suspect and it generates a cache validation request for the  first use of each such entry  the callback mechanism forces each server to maintain callback informa\\xad tion and each client to maintain validity information if the amount of callback   chapter  information maintained by a server is excessive the server can break callbacks  and reclaim some storage by unilaterally notifying clients and revoking the  validity of their cached files if the callback state maintained by venus gets  out of sync with the corresponding state maintained by the servers some  inconsistency may result  venus also caches contents of directories and syncbolic links for path\\xad name translation each component in the path name is fetched and a callback  is established for it if it is not already cached or if the client does not have  a callback on it venus does lookups on the fetched directories locally using  fids no requests are forwarded from one server to another at the end of a  path name traversal all the intermediate directories and the target file are in  the cache with callbacks on them future open calls to this file will involve no  network communication at all unless a callback is broken on a component of  the path name  the only exception to the caching policy is a modification to a directory  that is made directly on the server responsible for that directory for reasons  of integrity the vice interface has well defined operations for such purposes  venus reflects the changes in its cached copy to avoid re fetching the directory   implementation  client processes are interfaced to a unix kernel with the usual set of system  calls the kernel is modified slightly to detect references to vice files in the  relevant operations and to forward the requests to the client level venus process  at the workstation  venus carries out path name translation component by component as  described above it has a mapping cache that associates volumes to server  locations in order to avoid server interrogation for an already known volume  location if a volume is not present in this cache venus contacts any server  to which it already has a comcection requests the location information and  enters that information into the mapping cache unless venus already has  a connection to the server it establishes a new comcection it then uses this  connection to fetch the file or directory connection establishment is needed for  authentication and security purposes when a target file is found and cached a  copy is created on the local disk venus then returns to the kernel which opens  the cached copy and returns its handle to the client process  the unix file system is used as a low level storage system for both afs  servers and clients the client cache is a local directory on the workstation s  disk within this directory are files whose names are placeholders for cache  entries both venus and server processes access unix files directly by the latter s  inodes to avoid the expensive path name to inode translation routine namei  because the internal inode interface is not visible to client level processes both  venus and server processes are client level processes an appropriate set of  additional system calls was added dfs uses its own journaling file system to  improve performance and reliability over ufs  venus manages two separate caches one for status and the other for data  it uses a simple least recently used lru algorithm to keep each of them  bounded in size when a file is flushed from the cache venus notifies the  appropriate server to remove the callback for this file the status cache is kept  in virtual memory to allow rapid servicing of stat  file status returning     system calls the data cache is resident on the local disk but the unix i  buffering mechanism does some caching of disk blocks in memory that is  transparent to venus  a single client level process on each file server services all file req ests from  clients this process uses a lightweight process package with non preemptible  scheduling to service many client requests concurrently the rpc package  is integrated with the lightweight process package thereby allowing the file  server to concurrently make or service one rpc per lightweight process the  rpc package is built on top of a low level datagram abstraction whole file  transfer is implemented as a side effect of the rpc calls one rpc connection  exists per client but there is no a priori binding of lightweight processes to these  connections instead a pool of lightweight processes services client requests  on all connections the use of a single multithreaded server process allows the  caching of data structures needed to service requests on the negative side  a crash of a single server process has the disastrous effect of paralyzing this  particular server  a dfs is a file service system whose clients servers and storage devices are  dispersed among the sites of a distributed system accordingly service activity  has to be carried out across the network instead of a single centralized data  repository there are multiple independent storage devices  ideally a dfs should look to its clients like a conventional centralized  file system the multiplicity and dispersion of its servers and storage devices  should be made transparent that is the client interface of a dfs should not  distinguish between local and remote files it is up to the dfs to locate the  files and to arrange for the transport of the data a transparent dfs facilitates  client mobility by bringing the client s environment to the site where the client  logs in  there are several approaches to naming schemes in a dfs in the simplest  approach files are named by some combination of their host name and local  name which guarantees a unique system wide name another approach  popularized by nfs provides a means to attach remote directories to local  directories thus giving the appearance of a coherent directory tree  requests to access a remote file are usually handled by two complementary  methods with remote service requests for accesses are delivered to the server  the server machine performs the accesses and their results are forwarded  back to the client with caching if the data needed to satisfy the access request  are not already cached then a copy of the data is brought from the server  to the client accesses are performed on the cached copy the idea is to  retain recently accessed disk blocks in the cache so that repeated accesses  to the same information can be handled locally without additional network  traffic a replacement policy is used to keep the cache size bounded the  problem of keeping the cached copies consistent with the master file is the  cache consistency problem  there are two approaches to server side information either the server  tracks each file the client accesses or it simply provides blocks as the client  requests them without knowledge of their use these approaches are the  stateful versus stateless service paradigms   chapter  replication of files on different

transaction that executes either in isolation or concurrently  with other transactions in chapter we described various methods that an  operating system can use to deal with the deadlock problem in this chapter  we examine how centralized synchronization mechanisms can be extended to  a distributed environment we also discuss methods for handling deadlocks in  a distributed system  to describe various methods for achieving mutual exclusion in a distributed  system  to explain how atomic transactions can be implemented in a distributed  system  to show how some of the concurrency control schemes discussed in  chapter can be modified for use in a distributed environment  to present schemes for handling deadlock prevention deadlock avoid\\xad ance and deadlock detection in a distributed system  in a centralized system we can always determine the order in which two  events occurred since the system has a single common memory and clock  many applications may require us to determine order for example in a  resource allocation scheme we specify that a resource can be used only aft er  the resource has been granted a distributed system however has no common  memory and no common clock therefore it is sometimes impossible to say  which of two events occurred first the happened before relation discussed  next is only a partial ordering of the events in distributed systems since     chapter  the ability to define a total ordering is crucial in many applications we present  a distributed algorithm for extending the happened before relation to a consistent  total ordering of all the events in the system   the happened before relation  since we are considering only sequential processes all events executed in a  single process are totally ordered also by the law of causality a message can  be received only after it has been sent therefore we can define the happened\\xad before relation denoted by  on a set of events as follows assuming that  sending and receiving a message constitutes an event   if a and bare events in the same process and a was executed before b  then a  b  if a is the event of sending a message by one process and b is the event  of receiving that message by another process then a  b   if a  band b  c then a  c  since an event cannot happen before itself the  relation is an irreflexive  partial ordering  if two events a and b are not related by the  relation that is a did  not happen before b and b did not happen before a then we say that these  two events were executed in this case neither event can causally  affect the other if however a  b it is possible for event a to affect  event b causally  a space time diagram such as that in figure can best illustrate the  definitions of concurrency and happened before the horizontal direction repre\\xad sents space that is different processes and the vertical direction represents  time the labeled vertical lines denote processes or processors the labeled  dots denote events a wavy line denotes a message sent from one process to  another events are concurrent if and only if no path exists between them  for example these are some of the events related by the happened before  relation il figure  p  q  ro  q  q  r  p  q sil ce p  q and q  q  these are some of the concurrent events in the system  qo and p  ro and q  ro and p  q and p  we cannot know which of two concurrent events such as qo and p happened  first however since neither event can affect the other there is no way for one  of them to know whether the other has occurred yet it is not important which    p  figure relative time for three concurrent processes  happened first it is important only that any processes that care about the order  of two concurrent events agree on son e order   implementation  to determine that an event a happened before an event b we need either a  common clock or a set of perfectly synchronized clocks since neither of these  is available in a distributed system we must defil e the happened before relation  without the use of physical clocks  first we associate with each system event a we can then define  the requirement for every pair of events a and b if a b  then the timestamp of a is less than the timestamp of b below we will see  that the converse need not be true  how do we enforce the global ordering requirement in a distributed  environment we define within each process pi a logical lci the  logical clock can be implemented as a simple counter incremented between  any two successive events executed within a process since the logical clock  has a increasing value it assigns a unique number to every  event and if an event a occurs before event bin process pi then lci a  lc b the timestamp for an event is the value of the logical clock for that  event this scheme ensures that for any two events in the same process the  global orderil g requirement is met  unfortunately this scheme does not ensure that the global ordering  requirement is met across processes to illustrate the problem consider two  processes p and p that communicate with each other suppose that p sends  a message to p event a with lc a  and p receives the message   event b with lc b  because the processor for p is slower than the  processor for p its logical clock ticks more slowly this situation violates our  requirement since a b but the timestamp of a is greater than the timestamp  of b  to resolve this difficulty we require a process to advance its logical clock  when it receives a message whose timestamp is greater than the current value  of its logical clock in particulm if process pi receives a message event b with  timestamp t and lc b  t tlcenit should advance its clock so that lci b t   thus in our example when p receives the message from p it will advance  its logical clock so that lc b    chapter   finally to realize a total ordering we need only observe that with our  timestamp ordering scheme if the timestamps of two events a and b are the  same then the events are concurrent in this case we may use process identity  numbers to break ties and to create a total ordering the use of tirnestamps is  further discussed in section   in this section we present a number of different algorithms for implementing  mutual exclusion in a distributed environment we assume that the system  consists of n processes each of which resides at a different processor to simplify  our discussion we assume that processes are numbered uniquely from to n  and that a one to one mapping exists between processes and processors that  is each process has its own processor   centralized approach  in a centralized approach to providing mutual exclusion one of the processes  in the system is chosen to coordinate the entry to the critical section each  process that wants to invoke mutual exclusion sends a request message to the  coordinator when the process receives a reply message from the coordinator it  can enter its critical section after exiting its critical section the process sends  a release message to the coordinator and proceeds with its execution  on receiving a request message the coordinator checks to see whether some  other process is in its critical section if no process is in its critical section the  coordinator immediately sends back a reply message otherwise the request  is queued when the coordinator receives a release message it removes one  of the request messages from the queue in accordance with some scheduling  algorithm and sends a reply message to the requesting process  it should be clear that this algorithm ensures mutual exclusion in addition  if the scheduling policy within the coordinator is fair such as first come first\\xad served fcfs scheduling no starvation can occur this scheme requires three  messages per critical section entry a reques a reply and a release  if the coordinator process fails then a new process must take its place  in section we describe some algorithms for electing a unique new  coordinator once a new coordinator has been elected it must poll all the  processes in the system to reconstruct its request queue once the queue has  been constructed the computation can resume   fully distributed approach  if we want to distribute the decision making across the entire system then  the solution is far more complicated one approach described next uses an  algorithm based on the event ordering scheme described in section  when a process g wants to enter its critical section it generates a new  timestamp ts and sends the message request p ts to all processes in the  system including itself on receiving a request message a process may reply  immediately that is send a reply message back to p  or it may defer sending  a reply back because it is already in its critical section for example a process  that has received a reply message from all other processes in the system can    enter its critical section queueing incmning requests and deferring them after  exiting its critical section the process sends reply messages to all its deferred  requests  the decision whether process pi replies immediately to a request pj ts  message or defers its reply is based on three factors  if process pi is in its critical section then it defers its reply to pj  if process pi does not want to enter its critical section then it sends a reply  immediately to p j  if process p wants to enter its critical section but has not yet entered  it then it compares its own request timestamp with the timestamp of  the incoming request made by process pj if its own request timestamp  is greater than that of the incoming request then it sends a reply  immediately to pj pj asked first otherwise the reply is deferred  this algorithm exhibits the following desirable behavior  mutual exclusion is obtained  freedom from deadlock is ensured  freedom from starvation is ensured since entry to the critical section is  scheduled according to the timestamp ordering the timestamp ordering  ensures that processes are served in fcfs order  the number of messages per critical section entry is x n this number  represents the minimum number of required messages per critical section  entry when processes act independently and concurrently  to illustrate how the algorithm functions we consider a system consisting  of processes p p and p suppose that processes p and p want to enter  their critical sections process p then sends a message request p timestamp   to processes p and p while process p sends a message request p  timestamp to processes p and p the timestamps and were obtained  from the logical clocks described in section  when process p receives  these request messages it replies immediately when process p receives the  request from process p it replies immediately since the timestamp on its  own request message is greater than the timestamp for process p when  process p receives the request message from process p it defers its reply  since the timestamp on its request message is less than the timestamp  for the message from process p on receiving replies from both process p  and process p process p can enter its critical section after exiting its critical  section process p sends a reply to process p which can then enter its critical  section  because this scheme requires the participation of all the processes in the  system it has three undesirable consequences  the processes need to know the identity of all other processes in the  system when a new process joins the group of processes participating in  the mutual exclusion algorithm the following actions need to be taken   chapter  a the process must receive the names of all the other processes in the  grop  b the name of the new process must be distributed to all the other  processes in the group  this task is not as trivial as it may seem since some request and reply  messages may be circulating in the system when the new process joins  the group the interested reader is referred to the bibliographical notes  at the end of the chapter  if one process fails then the entire scheme collapses we can resolve this  difficulty by continuously monitoring the state of all processes in the  system if one process fails then all other processes are notified so that  they will no longer send request messages to the failed process when a  process recovers it must initiate the procedure that allows it to rejoin the  group  processes that have not entered their critical section must pause fre\\xad quently to assure other processes that they intend to enter the critical  section  because of these difficulties this protocol is best suited for small stable sets of  cooperating processes   token passing approach  another method of providilcg mutual exclusion is to circulate a token among  the processes ilc the system a is a special type of message that is passed  from process to process possession of the token entitles the holder to enter the  critical section since there is only a single token only one process can be in its  critical section at a time  we assume that the processes in the system are logically organized ilc a  the physical communication network need not be a ring as long as  the processes are connected to one another it is possible to implement a logical  ring to implement mutual exclusion we pass the token around the ring when  a process receives the token it may enter its critical section keeping the token  after the process exits its critical section the token is passed around again  if the process receiving the token does not want to enter its critical section  it passes the token to its neighbor this scheme is similar to algorithm in  chapter but a token is substituted for a shared variable  if the ring is unidirectional freedom from starvation is ensured the  number of messages required to implement mutual exclusion may vary from  one message per entry in the case of high contention that is every process  wants to enter its critical section to an infinite number of messages in the case  of low contention that is no process wants to enter its critical section  two types of failure must be considered first if the token is lost an election  must be called to generate a new token second if a process fails a new logical  ring must be established in section we present an election algorithm  others are possible the development of an algorithm for reconstructing the  ring is left to you in exercise     in chapter we introduced the concept of an atomic transaction which is a  program unit that must be executed that is either all the operations  associated with it are executed to completion or none are performed when we  are dealing with a distributed system ensuring the atomicity of a transaction  becomes much more complicated than in a centralized system this difficulty  occurs because several sites may be participating in the execution of a single  transaction the failure of one of these sites or the failure of a communication  link connecting the sites may result in erroneous computations  ensuring that the execution of transactions in the distributed system  preserves atomicity is the function of the each site has  its own local transaction coordinator which is responsible for coordinating the  execution of all the transactions initiated at that site for each such transaction  the coordinator is responsible for the following  ® starting the execution of the transaction  breaking the transaction into a number of subtransactions and distributing  these subtransactions to the appropriate sites for execution  coordinating the termination of the transaction which may result in the  transactions being committed at all sites or aborted at all sites  we assume that each local site maintains a log for recovery purposes   the two phase commit protocol  for atomicity to be ensured all the sites in which a transaction t has executed  must agree on the final outcome of the execution t must either commit at  all sites or it must abort at all sites to ensure this property the transaction  coordinator of t must execute a among the simplest and  most widely used commit protocols is the  which we discuss next  assume that t is a transaction initiated at site s and that the transaction  coordinator at s is c when t completes its execution that is when all the  sites at which t has executed inform c that t has completed then c starts  the pc protocol  phase c adds the record prepare t to the log and forces the record  onto stable storage it then sends a prepare t message to all the sites at  which t has executed on receiving the message the transaction manager  at each of these sites determines whether it is willing to commit its portion  oft if the answer is no it adds a record no t to the log and then it  responds by sending an abort t message to c if the answer is yes it adds  a record ready t to the log and forces all the log records corresponding  to t onto stable storage the transaction manager then replies with a ready   t message to c  phase when c has received responses to the prepare t message from  all the sites or when a pre specified interval of time has elapsed since the  prepare t message was sent out c can determine whether the transaction   chapter  t can be committed or aborted transaction t can be committed if c has  received a ready t m essage from all the participating sites otherwise  transaction t must be aborted depending on the verdict either a record   commit t or a record abort t is added to the log and forced onto  stable storage at this point the fate of the transaction has been sealed  following this the coordinator sends either a commit t or an abort t  message to all participating sites when a site receives that message it  records the message in the log  a site at which t has executed can unconditionally abort tat any time prior  to its sending the message ready t to the coordinator the ready t message  is in effect a promise by a site to follow the coordinator s order to commit tor  to abort t a site can make such a promise only when the needed information  is stored in stable storage otherwise if the site crashes after sending ready t  it may be unable to make good on its promise  since unanimity is required to commit a transaction the fate of t is sealed  as soon as at least one site responds with abort t note that the coordinator  site can decide unilaterally to abort t as it is one of the sites at which  t has executed the final verdict regarding t is determined at the time the  coordinator writes that verdict commit or abort to the log and forces it to  stable storage  in some implementations of the pc protocol a site sends an acknowledge   t message to the coordinator at the end of the second phase of the protocol  when the coordinator has received the acknowledge t message from all the  sites it adds the record complete t to the log   failure handling in pc  we now examine in detail how pc responds to various types of failures as  we shall see one major disadvantage of the pc protocol is that coordinator  failure may result in blocking and a decision either to commit or to abort t  may have to be postponed until the coordinator recovers   failure of a participating site  when a participating site s c recovers from a failure it must examine its log  to determine the fate of those transactions that were in the midst of execution  when the failure occurred suppose that tis one such transaction how will s c  deal with t we consider each of the possible alternatives  the log contain s a commit t record in this case the site executes  redo t  the log contains an abort t record in this case the site executes  undo t  the log contains a ready t record in this case the site must consult  c to determine the fate oft if c is up it tells s c whether t committed  or aborted in the former case it executes redo t in the latter case it  executes undo t if c is down s c must try to find out the fate of t  from other sites it does so by sending a query status t message to all  the sites in the system on receiving such a message a site must consult    its log to determine whether t has executed there and if so whether t  committed or aborted it then notifies s about this outcome if no site has  the appropriate information that is whether t corrnni tted or aborted then  s c can neither abort nor commit t the decision concerning tis postponed  until sc can obtain the needed information thus s c must periodically  resend the query status t message to the other sites it does so until a site  responds with the needed information the site at which c resides always  has this inforn ation  the log contains no control records abort commit ready concerning t  the absence of control records implies that sc failed before responding to  the prepare t message from c since the failure of sc means that it could  not have sent such a response by our algorithm c must have aborted t  hence sc must execute undo t   failure of the coordinator  if the coordinator fails in the midst of the execution of the commit protocol for  transaction t then the participating sites must decide the fate oft we shall see  that in certain cases the participating sites cannot decide whether to commit  or abort t and therefore these sites must wait for the recovery of the failed  coordinator  if an active site contains a commit t record in its log then t must be  committed  if an active site contains an abort t record in its log then t must be  aborted  if some active site does not contain a ready t record in its log then the  failed coordinator c cannot have decided to commit t we can draw this  conclusion because a site that does not have a ready t record in its log  cannot have sent a ready t message to c however the coordinator may  have decided to abort t rather than wait for c to recover it is preferable  to abort tin this case  if none of the preceding cases holds then all the active sites must have a   ready t record in their logs but no additional control records such  as abort t or commit t  since the coordinator has failed it is  impossible to determine whether a decision has been made or if so  what that decision is until the coordinator recovers thus the active  sites must wait for c to recover as long as the fate oft remains in doubt  t may continue to hold system resources for example if locking is used  t may hold locks on data at active sites such a situation is undesirable  because hours or days may pass before c is again active during this  time other transactions may be forced to wait for t as a result data are  unavailable not only on the failed site c but on active sites as well the  amount of unavailable data increases as the downtime of c grows this  situation is called the blocking problem because t is blocked pending the  recovery of site c   chapter    failure of the network  when a link fails the messages in the process of being routed through the  link do not arrive at their destinations intact from the viewpoint of the sites  connected throughout that link the other sites appear to have failed thus our  previous schemes apply here as well  when a number of links fail the network may partition in this case  two possibilities exist the coordinator and all its participants may remain in  one partition in this case the failure has no effect on the commit protocol  alternatively the coordinator and its participants may belong to several  partitions in this case messages between the participant and the coordinator  are lost reducing the case to a link failure  we move next to the issue of concurrency control in this section we show  how certain of the concurrency control schemes discussed in chapter can be  modified for use in a distributed environment  the transaction manager of a distributed database system manages the  execution of those transactions or subtransactions that access data stored  in a local site each such transaction may be either a local transaction   that is a transaction that executes only at that site or part of a global  transaction that is a transaction that executes at several sites each transaction  manager is responsible for maintaining a log for recovery purposes and for  participating in an appropriate concurrency control scheme to coordinate the  concurrent execution of the transactions executing at that site as we shall  see the concurrency schemes described in chapter need to be modified to  accommodate the distribution of transactions   locking protocols  the two phase locking protocols described in chapter can be used in a  distributed environment the only change needed is iil the way the lock  manager is implemented here we present several possible schemes the first  deals with the case where no data replication is allowed the others apply  to the more general case where data can be replicated in several sites as in  chapter we assume the existence of the shared and   nonreplicated scheme  if no data are replicated in the system then the locking schemes described in  section can be applied as follows each site maintains a local lock manager  whose function is to administer the lock and unlock requests for those data  items stored in that site when a transaction wishes to lock data item qat site  s it simply sends a message to the lock manager at site s requesting a lock   in a particular lock mode if data item q is locked in an incompatible mode  then the request is delayed until that request can be granted once it has been  determined that the lock request can be granted the lock n anager sends a  message back to the initiator indicating that the lock request has been granted    this scheme has the advantage of simple implementation it requires two  message transfers for handling lock requests and one ncessage transfer for  handling unlock requests however deadlock handling is more complex since  the lock and unlock requests are no longer made at a single site the various  deadlock handling algorithms discussed in chapter must be modified these  modifications are discussed in section   single coordinator approach  several concurrency control schemes can be used in systems that allow data  replication under the single coordinator approach the system maintains a  single lock manager that resides in a single chosen site say si all lock and  unlock requests are made at site si when a transaction needs to lock a data  item it sends a lock request to si the lock manager determines whether the  lock can be granted immediately if so it sends a message to that effect to the  site at which the lock request was initiated otherwise the request is delayed  until it can be granted and at that time a message is sent to the site at which  the lock request was initiated the transaction can read the data item from any  one of the sites at which a replica of the data item resides in the case of a  write operation all the sites where a replica of the data item resides must be  involved in the writing  the scheme has the following advantages  simple implementation this scheme requires two messages for handling  lock requests and one message for handling lmlock requests  simple deadlock handling since all lock and unlock requests are made  at one site the deadlock handling algorithms discussed in chapter can  be applied directly to this environment  the disadvantages of the scheme include the following  bottleneck the site si becomes a bottleneck since all requests must be  processed there  vulnerability if the site si fails the concurrency controller is lost either  processing must stop or a recovery scheme must be used  a compromise between these advantages and disadvantages can be  achieved through a in which the lock\\xad manager function is distributed over several sites each lock manager adminis\\xad ters the lock and unlock requests for a subset of the data items this distribution  reduces the degree to which the coordinator is a bottleneck but it complicates  deadlock handling since the lock and unlock requests are not made at a single  site   majority protocol  the majority protocol is a modification of the nonreplicated data scheme  presented earlier the system maintains a lock manager at each site each  manager controls the locks for all the data or replicas of data stored at that site  when a transaction wishes to lock a data item q that is replicated inn different   chapter  sites it must send a lock request to nlore than one half of then sites in which  q is stored each lock manager detern ines whether the lock can be granted  immediately as far as it is concerned as before the response is delayed until  the request can be granted the transaction does not operate on q until it has  successfully obtained a lock on a majority of the replicas of q  this scheme deals with replicated data in a decentralized manner thus  avoiding the drawbacks of central control however it suffers from its own  disadvantages  implementation the majority protocol is more complicated to implement  than the previous schemes it requires n  messages for handling  lock requests and n  messages for handling unlock requests  deadlock handling since the lock and unlock requests are not made  at one site the deadlock handling algorithms must be modified section   in addition a deadlock can occur even if only one data item is being  locked to illustrate consider a system with four sites and full replication  suppose that transactions t and t wish to lock data item q in exclusive  mode transaction t may succeed in locking q at sites and while  transaction t may succeed in locking q at sites and each then must  wait to acquire the third lock and hence a deadlock has occurred   biased protocol  the biased protocol is similar to the majority protocol the difference is that  requests for shared locks are given more favorable treatment than are requests  for exclusive locks the system maintains a lock manager at each site each  manager manages the locks for all the data items stored at that site shared and  exclusive locks are handled differently  shared locks when a transaction needs to lock data item q it simply  requests a lock on q from the lock manager at one site containing a replica  of q  exclusive locks when a transaction needs to lock data item q it requests  a lock on q from the lock manager at each site containing a replica of q  as before the response to the request is delayed until the request can be  granted  the scheme has the advantage of imposing less overhead on read opera\\xad tions than does the majority protocol this advantage is especially significant  in common cases in which the frequency of reads is much greater than the  frequency of writes however the additional overhead on writes is a dis\\xad advantage furthermore the biased protocol shares the majority protocol s  disadvantage of complexity in handling deadlock   primary copy  yet another alternative is to choose one of the replicas as the primary copy  thus for each data item q the primary copy of q must reside in precisely one  site which we call the primary site of q when a transaction needs to lock a data    item q it requests a lock at the primary site of q again the response to the  request is delayed until the request can be granted  this scheme enables us to handle concurrency control for replicated data  in much the same way as for unreplicated data implementation of the method  is simple however if the primary site of q fails q is inaccessible even though  other sites containing a replica may be accessible   timestamping  the principal idea behind the timestamping scheme discussed in section is  that each transaction is given a unique timestamp which is used to decide the  serialization order our first task then in generalizing the centralized scheme to  a distributed scheme is to develop a method for generating unique timestamps  our previous protocols can then be applied directly to the nonreplicated  environment   generation of unique timestamps  two primary methods are used to generate unique timestamps one is central\\xad ized and one is distributed in the centralized scheme a single site is chosen  for distributing the timestamps the site can use a logical counter or its own  local clock for this purpose  in the distributed scheme each site generates a local unique timestamp  using either a logical counter or the local clock the global unique timestamp  is obtained by concatenation of the local unique timestamp with the site  identifier which must also be unique figure  the order of concatenation  is important we use the site identifier in the least sign ificant position to ensure  that the global timestamps generated in one site are not always greater than  those generated in another site compare this technique for generating unique  timestamps with the one presented in section for generating unique  nanes  we may still have a problem if one site generates local timestamps at a  faster rate than do other sites in such a case the fast site s logical counter will  be larger than those of other sites therefore all timestamps generated by the  fast site will be larger than those generated by other sites a mechanism is  needed to ensure that local timestamps are generated fairly across the system  to accomplish the fair generation of timestamps we define within each site si a  logical clock lc which generates the local timestamp see section  to  ensure that the various logical clocks are synchronized we require that a site  local unique timestamp site identifier  ll  global unique identifier  figure generation of unique timestamps   chapter   si advance its logical clock whenever a transaction with timestarnp x y  visits that site and xis greater than the current value of lc in this case site si  advances its logical clock to the value x   if the system clock is used to generate timestamps then timestamps are  assigned fairly provided that no site has a system clock that runs fast or slow  since clocks may not be perfectly accurate a technique similar to that used for  logical clocks must be used to ensure that no clock gets far ahead or far behind  another clock   timestamp ordering scheme  the basic timestamp scheme introduced in section  can be extended in  a straightforward mam ler to a distributed system as in the centralized case  cascading rollbacks may result if no mechanism is used to prevent a transaction  from reading a data item value that is not yet committed to eliminate cascading  rollbacks we can con bine the basic timestamp scheme of section with the  pc protocol of section to obtain a protocol that ensures serializability  with no cascading rollbacks we leave the development of such an algorithm  to you  the basic timestamp scheme just described suffers from the undesirable  property that conflicts between transactions are resolved through rollbacks  rather than through waits to alleviate this problem we can buffer the various  read and write operations that is delay them until a time when we are  assured that these operations can take place without causing aborts a read x  operation by must be delayed if there exists a transaction tj that will perform  a wri te x operation but has not yet done so and ts tj ts  similarly a  wri te x operation by must be delayed if there exists a transaction tj that will  perform either a read x or a wri te x operation and ts tj ts t various  methods are available for this property one such method called  the scheme requires each site to maintain  a read queue and a write queue consisting of all the read and write requests  that are to be executed at the site and that must be delayed to preserve the  property just described we shall not present the scheme here again we leave  the development of the algorithm to you  the deadlock prevention deadlock avoidance and deadlock detection algo\\xad rithms presented in chapter can be extended so that they can be used in  a distributed system in this section we describe several of these distributed  algorithms   deadlock prevention and avoidance  the deadlock prevention and deadlock avoidance algorithms presented in  chapter can be used in a distributed system provided that appropriate  modifications are made for example we can use the resource ordering  deadlock prevention technique by simply defining a global ordering among  the system resources that is all resources in the entire system are assigned  unique numbers and a process may request a resource at any processor with    unique nlmber i only if it is not holding a resource with a unique number  greater than i similarly we can use the banker s algorithm in a distributed  systen l by designating one of the processes in the system the banker as the  process that maintains the information necessary to carry out the banker s  algorithm every resource request must be channeled through the banker  the global resource ordering deadlock prevention scheme is simple to  implement in a distributed environment and requires little overhead the  banker s algorithm can also be implemented easily but it may require too  much overhead the banker may become a bottleneck since the number of  messages to and from the banker may be large thus the banker s scheme  does not seem to be of practical use in a distributed system  we turn next to a new deadlock prevention scheme based on a timestamp\\xad ordering approach with resource preemption although this approach can  handle any deadlock situation that may arise in a distributed system for  simplicity we consider only the case of a single instance of each resource type  to control the preemption we assign a unique priority number to each  process these numbers are used to decide whether a process p should wait  for a process pj for example we can let p wait for pj if p has a priority higher  than that of pj otherwise p is rolled back this scheme prevents deadlocks  because for every edge p  pi in the wait for graph p has a higher priority  than p thus a cycle cannot exist  one difficulty with this scheme is the possibility of starvation some  processes with extremely low priorities may always be rolled back this  difficulty can be avoided through the use of timestamps each process in the  system is assigned a unique timestamp when it is created two complementary  deadlock prevention schemes using timestamps have been proposed   the wait die scheme this approach is based on a nonpreemptive  teclmique when process p requests a resource currently held by pj p is  allowed to wait only if it has a smaller timestamp than does pj that is p  is older than pj otherwise p is rolled back dies for example suppose  that processes p p and p have timestamps  and respectively  if p requests a resource held by p p will wait if p requests a resource  held by p p will be rolled back  the wound wait scheme this approach is based on a preemptive  technique and is a counterpart to the wait die approach when process  p requests a resource currently held by pj p is allowed to wait only  if it has a larger timestamp than does pi that is p is younger than  pi otherwise pi is rolled back pj is wounded by p  returning to our  previous example with processes p p and p if p requests a resource  held by p then the resource will be preempted from p and p will be  rolled back if p requests a resource held by p then p will wait  both schemes can avoid starvation provided that when a process is rolled  back it is not assigned a new timestamp since timestamps always increase a  process that is rolled back will eventually have the smallest timestamp thus  it will not be rolled back again there are however significant differences in  the way the two schemes operate   chapter  in the wait die scheme an older process must wait for a younger one to  release its resource thus the older the process gets the more it tends to  wait by contrast in the wound wait scheme an older process never waits  for a younger process  in the wait die scheme if a process pi dies and is rolled back because it  has requested a resource held by process pj then pi n ay reissue the same  sequence of requests when it is restarted if the resource is still held by pj  then pi will die again thus pi may die several times before acquiring the  needed resource contrast this series of events with what happens in the  wound wait scheme process pi is wounded and rolled back because pi  has requested a resource it holds when pi is restarted and requests the  resource now being held by pi pi waits thus fewer rollbacks occur in  the wound wait scheme  the major problem with both schemes is that unnecessary rollbacks may occur   deadlock detection  the deadlock prevention algorithm may preempt resources even if no dead\\xad lock has occurred to prevent um ecessary preemptions we can use a deadlock\\xad detection algorithm we construct a wait for graph describing the resource\\xad allocation state since we are assuming only a single resource of each type a  cycle in the wait for graph represents a deadlock  the main problem in a distributed system is deciding how to maintain  the wait for graph we illustrate this problem by describing several common  techniques to deal with this issue these schemes require each site to keep a  local wait for graph the nodes of the graph correspond to all the processes   local as well as nonlocal currently holding or requesting any of the resources  local to that site for example in figure we have a system consisting of two  sites each maintaining its local wait for graph note that processes p and p  appear in both graphs indicating that the processes have requested resources  at both sites  these local wait for graphs are constructed in the usual manner for local  processes and resources when a process pi in site needs a resource held by  process pj in site a request message is sent by pi to site the edge pi  pj is then inserted in the local wait for graph of site  figure two local wait for graphs    figure global wait for graph for figure  clearly if any local wait for graph has a cycle deadlock has occurred the  fact that we find no cycles in any of the local wait for graphs does not mean  that there are no deadlocks however to illustrate this problem we consider  the system depicted in figure each wait for graph is acyclic nevertheless  a deadlock exists in the system to prove that a deadlock has not occurred we  must show that the of all local graphs is acyclic the graph figure  that we obtain from the union of the two wait for graphs of figure does  indeed contain a cycle implying that the system is in a deadlocked state  a number of methods are available to organize the wait for graph in a  distributed system we describe several common schemes here   centralized approach  in the centralized approach a global wait for graph is constructed as the  tmion of all the local wait for graphs it is maintained in a single process  the since there is communication delay in  the system we must distinguish between two types of wait for graphs the  real graph describes the real but unknown state of the system at any point  in time as would be seen by an ormliscient observer the constructed graph  is an approximation generated by the coordinator during the execution of its  algorithm the constructed graph must be generated so that whenever the  detection algorithm is invoked the reported results are correct by correct we  mean the following  if a deadlock exists then it is reported properly  if a deadlock is reported then the system is indeed in a deadlocked state  as we shall show it is not easy to construct such correct algorithms  the wait for graph may be constructed at three different points in time  whenever a new edge is inserted in or removed from one of the local  wait for graphs  periodically when a number of changes have occurred in a wait for graph  whenever the deadlock detection coordinator needs to invoke the cycle\\xad detection algorithm  when the deadlock detection algorithm is invoked the coordinator searches  its global graph if a cycle is found a victim is selected to be rolled back the   chapter  coordinator must notify all the sites that a particular process has been selected  as victiitl the sites in turn roll back the victim process  next we consider each of the three graph construction options listed  above with option whenever an edge is either inserted in or removed from a  local graph the local site must also send a message to the coordinator to notify  it of this modification on receiving such a message the coordinator updates  its global graph  alternatively option a site can send a number of such changes in a single  message periodically returning to our previous example the coordinator  process will maintain the global wait for graph as depicted in figure  when site inserts the edge p p in its local wait for graph it also sends  a message to the coordinator similarly when site deletes the edge p p  because p has released a resource that was requested by ps an appropriate  message is sent to the coordinator  note that no matter which of these two options is used unnecessary  rollbacks may occur as a result of two situations   false may exist in the global wait for graph to illustrate this point  we consider a snapshot of the system as depicted in figure suppose  that p releases the resource it is holding in site resulting in the deletion  of the edge p p in site process p then requests a resource held  by p at site resulting in the addition of the edge p p in site if  the insert p p message from site arrives before the delete p p  message from site the coordinator may discover the false cycle p  p p p after the insert but before the delete deadlock recovery  may be initiated although no deadlock has occurred   unnecessary rollbacks may also result when a deadlock has indeed  occurred and a victim has been picked but at the same time one of the  processes has been aborted for reasons unrelated to the deadlock as  when a process has exceeded its allocated time for example suppose  that site in figure decides to abort p at the same time the  coordinator has discovered a cycle and picked p as a victim both p and  p are now rolled back although only p needed to be rolled back  now consider a centralized deadlock detection algorithm using option   that detects all deadlocks that actually occur and does not detect false  deadlocks to avoid the report of false deadlocks we require that requests  coordinator  figure local and global wait for graphs    from different sites be appended with unique identifiers or timestamps when  process p at site requests a resource from pj at site a request message  with timestamp t is sent the edge p p with the label t is inserted in the  local wait for graph of this edge is inserted in the local wait for graph of  site only if site has received the request message and cannot immediately  grant the requested resource a request from p to p in the same site is handled  in the usual manner no timestamps are associated with the edge p pi  the detection algorithm is as follows  the controller sends an initiating message to each site in the system  on receiving this message a site sends its local wait for graph to  the coordinator each of these wait for graphs contains all the local  information the site has about the state of the real graph the graph  reflects an instantaneous state of the site but it is not synchronized with  respect to any other site  when the controller has received a reply from each site it constructs a  graph as follows  a the constructed graph contains a vertex for every process in the  system  b the graph has an edge p  if the constructed graph contains a cycle then the system is in a deadlocked  state if the constructed graph does not contain a cycle then the system was  not in a deadlocked state when the detection algorithm was invoked as result  of the initiating messages sent by the coordinator in step   fully distributed approach  in the all controllers share  equally the responsibility for detecting deadlock every site constructs a wait\\xad for graph that represents a part of the total graph depending on the dynamic  behavior of the system the idea is that if a deadlock exists a cycle will appear  in at least one of the partial graphs we present one such algorithm which  involves construction of partial graphs in every site  each site maintains its own local wait for graph a local wait for graph in  this scheme differs from the one described earlier in that we add one additional  node pex to the graph an arc exists in the graph if p is waiting for a  data item in another site being held by any process similarly an arc pex pi  exists in the graph if a process at another site is waiting to acquire a resource  currently being held by p in this local site  to illustrate this situation we consider again the two local wait for graphs  of figure the addition of the node pex in both graphs results in the local  wait for graphs shown in figure  if a local wait for graph contains a cycle that does not involve node  pm then the system is in a deadlocked state if however a local graph  contains a cycle involving pex then this implies the possibility of a deadlock   chapter  figure augmented local wait for graphs from figure  to ascertain whether a deadlock does exist we must invoke a distributed  deadlock detection algorithm  suppose that at site si the local wait for graph contains a cycle involving  node pex· this cycle must be of the form  which indicates that process pk in site si is waiting to acquire a data item  located in some other site say sj on discovering this cycle site si sends to  site si a deadlock detection message containing information about that cycle  when site si receives this deadlock detection message it updates its  local wait for graph with the new information then it searches the newly  constructed wait for graph for a cycle not involving pex· if one exists a  deadlock is found and an appropriate recovery scheme is iiwoked if a cycle  involving pex is discovered then si transmits a deadlock detection message  to the appropriate site say sk site sic in return repeats the procedure  thus after a finite number of rounds either a deadlock is discovered or the  deadlock detection computation halts  to illustrate this procedure we consider the local wait for graphs of figure   suppose that site discovers the cycle  since p is waiting to acquire a data item in site a deadlock detection  message describing that cycle is transmitted from site to site when site  receives this message it updates its local wait for graph obtaining the wait for  graph of figure this graph contains the cycle  which does not include node pex· therefore the system is in a deadlocked state  and an appropriate recovery scheme must be invoked  note that the outcome would be the same if site discovered the cycle first  in its local wait for graph and sent the deadlock detection message to site  in the worst case both sites will discover the cycle at about the same time and  two deadlock detection messages will be sent one by to and another by  s to this situation results in unnecessary message transfer and overhead in  updating the two local wait for graphs and searching for cycles in both graphs     figure augmented local wait for graph in site z of figure  to reduce message traffic we assign to each process pi a unique identifier  which we denote id pi when site sk discovers that its local wait for graph  contains a cycle involving node pex of the form  it sends a deadlock detection message to another site only if  id pi j id pr j  otherwise site sc continues its normal execution leaving the burden of  initiating the deadlock detection algorithm to some other site  to illustrate this scheme we consider again the wait for graphs maintained  at sites and as shown in figure suppose that  suppose both sites discover these local cycles at about the same time the cycle  in site is of the form  since id p id p site does not send a deadlock detection message to  site  the cycle in site is of the form  since id p id p site does send a deadlock detection message to site   which on receiving the message updates its local wait for graph site s  then searches for a cycle in the graph and discovers that the system is in a  deadlocked state  as we pointed out in section many distributed algorithms employ a  coordinator process that performs functions needed by the other processes in   chapter  the systenc these functions include enforcing mutual exclusion maintaining  a global wait for graph for deadlock detection replacing a lost token and  controlling an input or output device in the system if the coordinator process  fails due to the failure of the site at which it resides the system can continue  execution only by restarting a new copy of the coordinator on some other site  the algorithms that determine where a new copy of the coordinator should be  restarted are called  election algorithms assume that a unique priority number is associated  with each active process in the system for ease of notation we assume that  the priority number of process g is i to simplify our discussion we assume  a one to one correspondence between processes and sites and thus refer to  both as processes the coordinator is always the process with the largest  priority number hence when a coordinator fails the algorithm must elect  that active process with the largest priority number this number must be sent  to each active process in the system in addition the algorithm must provide a  mechanism for a recovered process to identify the current coordinator  in this section we present examples of election algorithms for two different  configurations of distributed systems the first algorithm applies to systems  where every process can send a message to every other process in the system  the second algorithm applies to systems organized as a ring logically or  physically both algorithms require n messages for an election where n is the  number of processes in the system we assume that a process that has failed  knows on recovery that it has indeed failed and thus takes appropriate actions  to rejoin the set of active processes   the bully algorithm  suppose that process p sends a request that is not answered by the coordinator  within a time interval t in this situation it is assumed that the coordinator has  failed and p tries to elect itself as the new coordinator this task is completed  through the following algorithm  process p sends an election message to every process with a higher priority  number process p then waits for a time interval t for an answer from any one  of these processes  if no response is received within time t p assumes that all processes with  numbers greater than i have failed and elects itself the new coordinator process  p restarts a new copy of the coordinator and sends a message to inform all  active processes with priority numbers less than i that p is the new coordinator  however if an answer is received p begins a time interval t waiting to  receive a message informing it that a process with a higher priority number  has been elected that is some other process is electing itself coordinator and  should report the results within time t if no message is received within t  then the process with a higher number is assumed to have failed and process  p should restart the algorithm  if p is not the coordinator then at any time during execution p may  receive one of the following two messages from process pr  p is the new coordinator j i process p in turn records this  information    pi has started an election j i process p sends a response to pi  and begins its own election algorithm provided that p has not already  initiated such an election  the process that completes its algorithm has the highest number and is elected  as the coordinator it has sent its number to all active processes with lower  numbers after a failed process recovers it immediately begins execution of  the same algorithm if there are no active processes with higher numbers the  recovered process forces all processes with lower numbers to let it become the  coordinator process even if there is a currently active coordinator with a lower  number for this reason the algorithm is termed the  we can demonstrate the operation of the algorithm with a simple example  of a system consisting of processes p through p the operations are as follows  all processes are active p is the coordinator process  p and p fail p determines that p has failed by sending a request that  is not answered within time t p then begins its election algorithm by  sending a request to p  p receives the request responds to p and begins its own algorithm by  sending an election request to p  p receives p s response and begins waiting for an interval t  p does not respond within an interval t so p elects itself the new  coordinator and sends the number to p and p p does not receive  the number since it has failed  later when p recovers it sends an election request to p p and p  p and p respond to p and begin their own election algorithms p will  again be elected through the same events as before  finally p recovers and notifies p p and p that it is the current  coordinator p sends no election requests since it is the process with  the highest number in the system   the ring algorithm  the assumes that the links between processes are unidirectional  and that each process sends its messages to the neighbor on the right the main  data structure used by the algorithm is the lisi a list that contains the  priority numbers of all active processes in the system when the algorithm ends  each process maintains its own active list the algorithm works as follows  if process p detects a coordinator failure it creates a new active list that  is initially empty it then sends a message elect i to its neighbor on the  right and adds the number i to its active list   chapter   if pi receives a message elect j from the process on the left it must respond  in one of three ways  a if this is the first elect message it has seen or sent pi creates a new  active list with the numbers i and j it then sends the message elect i  followed by the message elect j  b ifi f j thatis ifthe message received does not contain pi snumber   then pi adds j to its active list and forwards the message to its  neighbor on the right  c if i j that is if pi receives the message elect i then the active  list for pi now contains the numbers of all the active processes in  the system process g can now determine the largest number in the  active list to identify the new coordinator process  this algorithm does not specify how a recovering process determines the  number of the current coordinator process one solution requires a recovering  process to send an inquiry message this message is forwarded around the ring  to the current coordinator which in turn sends a reply containing its number  for a system to be reliable we need a mechanism that allows a set of processes  to agree on a common value such an agreement may not take place for several  reasons first the communication medium may be faulty resulting in lost or  garbled messages second the processes themselves may be faulty resultilcg  lie unpredictable process behavior the best we can hope for in this case is that  processes fail in a clean way stopping their execution without deviating from  their normal execution pattern in the worst case processes may send garbled  or incorrect messages to other processes or even collaborate with other failed  processes in an attempt to the integrity of the system  the provides an analogy for this situation  several divisions byzantine army each commanded by its own general  surround an enemy camp the byzantine generals must reach agreement on  whether or not to attack the enemy at dawn it is crucial that all generals agree  since an attack by only some of the divisions would result lie defeat the various  divisions are geographically dispersed and the generals can communicate with  one another only via messengers who run from camp to camp the generals  may not be able to reach agreement for at least two major reasons  messengers may get caught by the enemy and thus may be unable to  deliver their messages this situation corresponds to unreliable com\\xad munication in a computer system and is discussed further in section    generals may be traitors trying to prevent the loyal generals from  reaching an agreement this situation corresponds to faulty processes  lie a computer system and is discussed further in section      unreliable communications  let us first assume that if processes fail they do so in a clean way and that  the communication medium is unreliable suppose that process p at site  which has sent a message to process pj at site needs to know whether  p has received the message so that it can decide how to proceed with its  computation for example p may decide to compute a functionfoo if pj has  received its message or to compute a function boo if p has not received the  message because of some hardware failure  to detect failures we can use a similar to the one  described in section  when p sends out a message it also specifies  a time interval during which it is willing to wait for an acknowledgment  message from pi when pi receives the message it immediately sends an  acknowledgment to p if p receives the acknowledgment message within the  specified time interval it can safely conclude that p has received its message  if however a time out occurs then p needs to retransmit its message and  wait for an acknowledgment this procedure continues until p either gets the  acknowledgment message back or is notified by the system that site is down  in the first case it will compute foo in the latter case it will compute boo note  that if these are the only two viable alternatives p must wait until it has been  notified that one of the situations has occurred  suppose now that p also needs to know that p has received its acknowl\\xad edgment message so that it can decide how to proceed with its computation  for example p may want to compute foo only if it is assured that p got  its acknowledgment in other words p and pi will compute foo if and only  if both have agreed on it it turns out that in the presence of failure it is  not possible to accomplish this task more precisely it is not possible in a  distributed environment for processes p and p to agree completely on their  respective states  to prove this claim let us suppose that a minimal sequence of message  transfers exists such that after the messages have been delivered both  processes agree to compute foo let m be the last message sent by p to  pj since g does not know whether its message will arrive at pj since the  message may be lost due to a failure p will execute foo regardless of the  outcome of the message delivery thus m could be removed from the sequence  without affecting the decision procedure hence the original sequence was not  minimal contradicting our assumption and showing that there is no sequence  the processes can never be sure that both will compute foo   faulty processes  now let us assume that the communication medium is reliable but that  processes can fail in unpredictable ways consider a system of n processes  of which no more than m are faulty suppose that each process p has some  private value of v we wish to devise an algorithm that allows each nonfaulty  process p to construct a vector x  a l a   a such that the following  conditions exist   if pi is a nonfaulty process then a i vi  if p and p are both nonfaulty processes then x x   chapter   there are many solutions to this problem and they share the following  properties  a correct algorithm can be devised only if n x m   the worst case delay for reaching agreement is proportionate tom  message passing delays  the number of messages required for reaching agreement is large no  single process is trustworthy so all processes must collect all information  and make their own decisions  rather than presenting a general solution which would be complicated we  present an algorithm for the simple case where m and n  the algorithm  requires two rounds of information exchange  each process sends its private value to the other three processes  each process sends the information it has obtained in the first round to  all other processes  a faulty process obviously may refuse to send messages in this case a  nonfaulty process can choose an arbitrary value and pretend that the value  was sent by the faulty process  once these two rounds are completed a nonfaulty process pi can construct  its vector x  ai l a ai a as follows  ai v  for j i if at least two of the three values reported for process pj in  the two rounds of exchange agree then the majority value is used to set  the value of ai f otherwise a default value say nil is used to set the  value of ai f  in a distributed system with no common memory and no common clock it  is sometimes impossible to determine the exact order in which two events  occur the happened before relation is only a partial ordering of the events in  a distributed system timestamps can be used to provide a consistent event  ordering  mutual exclusion in a distributed environment can be implemented in a  variety of ways in a centralized approach one of the processes in the system  is chosen to coordinate the entry to the critical section in the fully distributed  approach the decision making is distributed across the entire system a  distributed algorithm which is applicable to ring structured networks is the  token passing approach  for atomicity to be ensured all the sites in which a transaction t has  executed must agree on the final outcome of the execution t either commits at  all sites or aborts at all sites to ensure this property the transaction coordinator    of t must execute a commit protocol the most widely used commit protocol  is the pc protocol  the various concurrency control schemes that can be used in a centralized  system can be modified for use in a distributed environment in the case  of locking protocols we need only change the way the lock manager is  implemented in the case of timestamping and validation schemes the only  change needed is the development of a mechanism for generating unique  global timestamps the mechanism can either concatenate a local timestamp  with the site identification or advance local clocks whenever a message arrives  that has a larger timestamp  the primary method for dealing with deadlocks in a distributed environ\\xad ment is deadlock detection the main problem is deciding how to maintain the  wait for graph methods for organizing the wait for graph include a centralized  approach and a fully distributed approach  some distributed algorithms require the use of a coordinator if the  coordinator fails because of the failure of the site at which it resides the system  can continue execution only by restarting a new copy of the coordinator on  some other site it can do so by maintaining a backup coordinator that is  ready to assume responsibility if the coordinator fails another approach is to  choose the new coordinator after the coordinator has failed the algorithms  that determine where a new copy of the coordinator should be restarted are  called election algorithms two algorithms the bully algorithm and the ring  algorithm can be used to elect a new coordinator in case of failures   why is deadlock detection much more expensive in a distributed  environment than in a centralized environment   consider a hierarchical deadlock detection algorithm in which the  global wait for graph is distributed over a number of different con\\xad trollers which are organized in a tree each non leaf controller maintains  a wait for graph that contains relevant information from the graphs of  the controllers in the subtree below it in particular let sa sp and sc  be controllers such that sc is the lowest common ancestor of sa and  sp sc must be unique since we are dealing with a tree suppose that  node ti appears in the local wait for graph of controllers sa and sp  then must also appear in the local wait for graph of  controller sc  every controller in the path from sc to sa  every controller in the path from sc to sp  in addition if and tj appear in the wait for graph of controller so  and there exists a path from ti to ti in the wait for graph of one of the  children of s then an edge  tj must be in the wait for graph  of so  show that if a cycle exists in any of the wait for graphs then the  system is deadlocked   chapter   your company is building a comp ter network and you are asked to  develop a scheme for dealing with the deadlock problem  a would you use a deadlock detection scheme

guarantee if event a happens before event b then the  timestamp of a is smaller than the timestamp of b note however that  we cam t order two events based only on their timestamps the fact  that an event c has a timestamp that is smaller than the timestamp  of event d does not necessarily mean that event c happened before  event d c and d could be concurrent events in the system discuss  ways in which the logical clock timestamp scheme could be extended  to distinguish concurrent events from events that can be ordered by the  happened before relation  the distributed algorithm for extending

vision control system  identifies a wall after the robot has walked into it despite correctly identifying  the wall the system has not met its requirement contrast this timing  requirement with the much less strict demands of other systems in an  interactive desktop computer system it is desirable to provide a quick response  time to the interactive user but it is not mandatory to do so some systems   such as a batch processing system m ay have no timing requirements  whatsoever  real time systems executing on traditional computer hardware are used  in a wide range of applications in addition many real time systems are     chapter   embedded in specialized devices such as ordinary home appliances for  example microwave ovens and dishwashers consumer digital devices for  exarnple cameras and mp players and communication devices for example  cellular telephones and blackberry handheld devices they are also present  in larger entities such as automobiles and airplanes an embedded system is  a computing device that is part of a larger system in which the presence of a  computing device is often not obvious to the user  to illustrate consider an embedded system for controlling a home dish\\xad washer the embedded system may allow various options for scheduling the  operation of the dishwasher the water temperature the type of cleaning   light or heavy even a timer indicating when the dishwasher is to start most  likely the user of the dishwasher is unaware that there is in fact a computer  embedded in the appliance as another example consider an embedded system  controlling antilock brakes in an automobile each wheel in the automobile has  a sensor detecting how much sliding and traction are occurring and each  sensor continually sends its data to the system controller taking the results  from these sensors the controller tells the braking mechanism in each wheel  how much braking pressure to apply again to the user in this instance the  driver of the automobile the presence of an embedded computer system may  not be apparent it is important to note however that not all embedded systems  are real time for example an embedded system controlling a home furnace  may have no real time requirements whatsoever  some real time systems are identified as safety critical systems in a  safety critical system incorrect operation usually due to a missed deadline   results in some sort of catastrophe examples of safety critical systems  include weapons systems antilock brake systems flight management systems  and health related embedded systems such as pacemakers in these scenarios  the real time system must respond to events by the specified deadlines  otherwise serious injury or worse might occur however a significant  majority of embedded systems do not qualify as safety critical including fax  machines microwave ovens wristwatches and networking devices such as  switches and routers for these devices missing deadline requirements results  in nothing more than perhaps an unhappy user  real time computing is of two types hard and soft a hard real time  system has the most stringent requirements guaranteeing that critical real\\xad time tasks be completed within their deadlines safety critical systems are  typically hard real time systems a soft real time system is less restrictive  simply providing that a critical real time task will receive priority over other  tasks and that it will retain that priority until it completes many commercial  operating systems as well as linux provide soft real time support  in this section we explore the characteristics of real time systems and address  issues related to designing both soft and hard real time operating systencs  the following characteristics are typical of many real time systems  single purpose  small size  inexpensively mass produced  specific timing requirements  we next examine each of these characteristics  unlike pcs which are put to many uses a real time system typically serves  only a single purpose such as controlling antilock brakes or delivering music  on an mp player it is unlikely that a real time system controlling an airliner s  navigation system will also play dvds the design of a real time operating  system reflects its single purpose nature and is often quite simple  many real time systems exist in environments where physical space is  constrained consider the amount of space available in a wristwatch or a  microwave oven it is considerably less than what is available in a desktop  computer as a result of space constraints most real time systems lack both  the cpu processing power and the amount of memory available in standard  desktop pcs whereas most contemporary desktop and server systems use  or bit processors many real time systems run on or bit processors  similarly a desktop pc might have several gigabytes of physical memory  whereas a real time system might have less than a megabyte we refer to the  amount of memory required to run the operating system and its applications  as the footprint of a system because the amount of memory is limited most  real time operating systems must have small footprints  next consider where many real time systems are implemented they are  often found in home appliances and consumer devices devices such as digital  cameras microwave ovens and thermostats are mass produced in very cost\\xad conscious environments thus the microprocessors for real time systems must  also be inexpensively mass produced  one technique for reducing the cost of an embedded controller is to  use an alternative technique for organizing the components of the computer  system rather than organizing the computer around the structure shown in  figure where buses provide the mechanism intercomectin g individual  components many embedded system controllers use a strategy known as  here the cpu memory including cache memory  mouse keyboard printer  figure bus oriented organization   chapter   management unit mmu and any attached peripheral ports such as usb ports  are contained in a single integrated circuit the soc strategy is typically less  expensive than the bus oriented organization of figure  we turn now to the final characteristic identified above for real time  systems specific timing requirements it is in fact the defining characteristic  of such systems accordingly the primary task of both hard and soft real time  operating systems is to support the timing requirements of real time tasks  and the remainder of this chapter focuses on this issue real time operating  systems meet tim ing requirements by using scheduling algorithms that give  real time processes the highest schedulil g priorities furthermore schedulers  must ensure that the priority of a real time task does not degrade over time  another technique for addressing timing requirements is by minimizing the  response time to events such as il terrupts  in this section we discuss the features necessary for designing an operating  system that supports real time processes before we begin though let s  consider what is typically not needed for a real time system we begin  by examining several features provided in many of the operatil g systems  discussed so far in this text including linux unix and the various versions  of windows these systems typically provide support for the following  a variety of peripheral devices such as graphical displays cd drives and  dvd drives  protection and security mechanisms  multiple users  supporting these features often results in a sophisticated and large kernel  for example windows xp has over forty million lines of source code in  contrast a typical real time operating system usually has a very simple design  often written in thousands rather than millions of lines of source code we  would not expect these simple systems to il clude the features listed above  but why don t real time systems provide these features which are crucial to  standard desktop and server systems there are several reasons but three are  most prominent first because most real time systems serve a single purpose  they simply do not require many of the features found il a desktop pc  consider a digital wristwatch it obviously has no need to support a disk drive  or dvd let alone virtual memory furthermore a typical real time system  does not include the notion of a user the system simply supports a small  number of tasks which often await input from hardware devices sensors  vision identification and so forth second the features supported by standard  desktop operating systems are impossible to provide without fast processors  and large amounts of memory both of these are unavailable in real time  systems due to space constraints as explained earlier in addition many real\\xad time systems lack sufficient space to support peripheral disk drives or graphical  displays although some systems may support file systems using nonvolatile  memory nvram third supporting features common in standard desktop    p l  relocation  register  r  p physical  memory  figure address translation in real time systems  computing environments would greatly increase the cost of real time systems  which could make such systems economically impractical  additional considerations arise when we consider virtual memory in a  real time system providing virtual memory features as described in chapter   requires that the system include a memory management unit mmu for  translating logical to physical addresses however mmus typically increase  the cost and power consumption of the system in addition the time required  to translate logical addresses to physical addresses especially in the case of a  translation look aside buffer tlb miss may be prohibitive in a hard real time  environment in the following discussion we examine several approaches for  translating addresses in real time systems  figure illustrates three different strategies for managing address  translation available to designers of real time operating systems in this  scenario the cpu generates logical address l which must be mapped to  physical address p the first approach is to bypass logical addresses and  have the cpu generate physical addresses directly this teclmique kn own  as real addressing mode does not employ virtual memory techniques and  is effectively stating that p equals l one problem with real addressil g mode  is the absence of memory protection between processes real addressing mode  may also require that programmers specify the physical location where their  programs are loaded into memory however the benefit of this approach  is that the system is quite fast as no time is spent on address translation  real addressing mode is quite common in embedded systems with hard  real time constraints in fact some real time operating systems rum ing on  microprocessors containing an mmu actually disable the mmu to gain the  performance benefit of referencing physical addresses directly  a second strategy for translating addresses is to use an approach similar  to the dynamic relocation register shown in figure in this scenario a  relocation register r is set to the memory location where a program is loaded  the physical address p is generated by adding the contents of the relocation  register r to l some real time systems configure the mmu to perform this way  the obvious benefit of this strategy is that the mmu can easily translate logical  addresses to physical addresses using p l r however this system still  suffers from a lack of memory protection between processes   chapter   the last approach is for the real time system to provide full virtual memory  functionality as described in chapter in this instance address translation  takes place via page tables and a translation look aside buffer or tlb in  addition to allowing a program to be loaded at any memory location this  strategy also provides memory protection between processes for systems  without attached disk drives demand paging and swapping may not be  possible however systems may provide such features using nvram flash  memory the lynxos and on core systems are examples of real time operating  systems providing full support for virtual memory  keeping in mind the many possible variations we now identify the features  necessary for implementing a real time operating system this list is by no  means absolute some systems provide more features than we list below while  other systems provide fewer  preemptive priority based scheduling  preemptive kernel  minimized latency  one notable feature we omit from this list is networking support how\\xad ever deciding whether to support networking protocols such as tcp ip is  simple if the real time system must be connected to a network the operating  system must provide networking capabilities for example a system that  gathers real time data and transmits it to a server must obviously include  networking features alternatively a self contained embedded system requir\\xad ing no interaction with other computer systems has no obvious networking  requirencent  in the remainder of this section we examine the basic requirements listed  above and identify how they can be implemented in a real time operating  system   priority based scheduling  the most important feature of a real time operating system is to respond  immediately to a real time process as soon as that process requires the cpu  as a result the scheduler for a real time operating system must support a  priority based algorithm with preemption recall that priority based schedul\\xad ing algorithms assign each process a priority based on its importance more  important tasks are assigned higher priorities than those deemed less impor\\xad tant if the scheduler also supports preemption a process currently running  on the cpu will be preempted if a higher priority process becomes available to  run  preemptive priority based scheduling algorithms are discussed in detail  in chapter where we also present examples of the soft real time scheduling  features of the solaris windows xp and linux operating systems each of  these systems assigns real time processes the highest scheduling priority for    example windows xp has different priority levels the highest levels\\xad priority values to are reserved for real time processes solaris and  linux have similar prioritization schemes  note however that providing a preemptive priority based scheduler only  guarantees soft real time functionality hard real time systems must further  guarantee that real time tasks will be serviced in accord with their deadline  requirem ents and making such guarantees may require additional scheduling  features in section we cover scheduling algorithms appropriate for hard  real time systems   preemptive kernels  nonpreemptive kernels disallow preemption of a process running in kernel  mode a kernel mode process will run until it exits kernel mode blocks or  voluntarily yields control of the cpu in contrast a preemptive kernel allows  the preemption of a task running in kernel mode designing preemptive  kernels can be quite difficult and traditional user oriented applications such  as spreadsheets word processors and web browsers typically do not require  such quick response times as a result some commercial desktop operating  systems such as windows xp are nonpreemptive  however to meet the timing requirements of real time systems in partic\\xad ular hard real time systems preemptive kernels are mandatory otherwise  a real time task might have to wait an arbitrarily long period of time while  another task was active in the kernel  there are various strategies for making a kernel preemptible one approach  is to insert preemption points in long duration system calls a preemption  point checks to see whether a high priority process needs to be nm if so a  context switch takes place then when the high priority process terminates  the interrupted process continues with the system call preemption points  can be placed only at safe locations in the kernel that is only where kernel  data structures are not being modified a second strategy for making a kernel  preemptible is through the use of synchronization mechanisms discussed in  chapter with this method the kernel can always be preemptible because any  kernel data being updated are protected from modification by the high priority  process   minimizing latency  consider the event driven nature of a real time system the system is typically  waiting for an event in real time to occur events may arise either in software   as when a timer expires or in hardware as when a remote controlled  vehicle detects that it is approaching an obstruction when an event occurs the  system must respond to and service it as quickly as possible we refer to event  latency as the amount of time that elapses from when an event occurs to when  it is serviced figure   usually different events have different latency requirements for example  the latency requirement for an antilock brake system might be three to five  milliseconds meaning that from the time a wheel first detects that it is sliding  the system controlling the antilock brakes has three to five milliseconds to  respond to and control the situation any response that takes longer might  result in the automobile s veering out of control in contrast an embedded   chapter  event e first occurs  event latency  real time system responds to e  time  figure event latency  system controlling radar in an airliner might tolerate a latency period of several  seconds  two types of latencies affect the performance of real time systems  interrupt latency  dispatch latency  interrupt latency refers to the period of time from the arrival of an interrupt  at the cpu to the start of the routine that services the interrupt when an  interrupt occursf the operating system must first complete the instruction it  is executing and determine the type of interrupt that occurred it must then  save the state of the current process before servicing the interrupt using the  specific interrupt service routine isr the total time required to perform these  tasks is the interrupt latency figure  obviouslyf it is crucial for real time  task t running interrupt   determine or interrupt  type  context o witoi  interrupt  latency  time i ish i  figure interrupt latency    operating systems to minimize interrupt latency to ensure that real time tasks  receive immediate attention  one important factor contributing to interrupt latency is the amomrt  of time interrupts may be disabled while kernel data structures are being  updated real time operating systems require that interrupts be disabled for  very short periods of time however for hard real time systems interrupt  latency must not only be minimized it must in fact be bounded to guarantee  the deterministic behavior required of hard real time kernels  the amount of time required for the schedulil g dispatcher to stop one  process and start another is known as dispatch latency providing real time  tasks with immediate access to the cpu mandates that real time operating  systems minimize this latency the most effective technique for keeping  dispatch latency low is to provide preemptive kernels  in figure we diagram the makeup of dispatch latency the conflict  phase of dispatch latency has two components  preemption of any process running in the kernel  release by low priority processes of resources needed by a high priority  process  as an example in solaris the dispatch latency with preemption disabled is  over a hundred milliseconds with preemption enabled it is reduced to less  than a millisecond  one issue that can affect dispatch latency arises when a higher priority  process needs to read or modify kernel data that are currently beil g accessed  by a lower priority process or a chain of lower priority processes as kernel  event response to event  figure dispatch latency real time  process  execution   chapter   data are typically protected with a lock the higher priority process will have to  wait £or a lower priority one to finish with the resource the situation becomes  more complicated i£ the lower priority process is preempted in favor of yet  another process with a higher priority as an example assume we have three  processes l m and h whose priorities follow the order l m h also  assume that process h requires resource r which is currently being accessed  by process l ordinarily process h would wait for l to finish using resource r  howevet now suppose that process m becomes runnable thereby preempting  process l indirectly a process with a lower priority process m has affected  how long process h must wait for l to relinquish resource r  this problem known as priority inversion can be solved by use of the  priority inheritance protocol according to this protocol all processes that  are accessing resources needed by a higher priority process inherit the higher  priority until they are finished with the resources in question when they  are finished their priorities revert to their original values in the example  above a priority inheritance protocol allows process l to temporarily inherit  the priority of process h thereby preventing process m from preempting its  execution when process l has finished using resource r it relinquishes its  inherited priority from h and assumes its original priority as resource r is  now available process h not m will run next  our coverage of scheduling so far has focused primarily on soft real time  systems as mentioned though scheduling for such systems provides no  guarantee on when a critical process will be scheduled it guarantees only that  the process will be given preference over noncritical processes hard real time  systems have stricter requirements a task must be serviced by its deadline  service after the deadline has expired is the same as no service at all  we now consider scheduling for hard real time systems before we proceed  with the details of the individual schedulers however we must define certain  characteristics of the processes that are to be scheduled first the processes  are considered periodic that is they require the cpu at constant intervals   periods each periodic process has a fixed processing timet once it acquires  the cpu a deadline d by which time it must be serviced by the cpu and a  period p the relationship of the processing time the deadline and the period  can be expressed as  t  d  p the rate of a periodic task is i p figure  p  d  period d  period d   i  lc j  figure periodic task time  period    illustrates the execution of a periodic process over time schedulers can take  advantage of this relationship and assign priorities according to the deadline  or rate requirements of a periodic process  what is unusual about this form of scheduling is that a process may have to  announce its deadline requirements to the scheduler then using a technique  known as an admission control algorithm the scheduler either admits the  process guaranteeing that the process will complete on time or rejects the  request as impossible if it cannot guarantee that the task will be serviced by its  deadline  in the following sections we explore scheduling algorithms that address  the deadline requirements of hard real time systems   rate monotonic scheduling  the rate monotonic scheduling algorithm schedules periodic tasks using a  static priority policy with preemption if a lower priority process is running  and a higher priority process becomes available to run it will preempt the  lower priority process upon entering the system each periodic task is assigned  a priority inversely based on its period the shorter the period the higher the  priority the longer the period the lower the priority the rationale behind this  policy is to assign a higher priority to tasks that require the cpu more often  furthermore rate monotonic scheduling assumes that the processing time of  a periodic process is the same for each cpu burst that is every time a process  acquires the cpu the duration of its cpu burst is the same  let s consider an example we have two processes p and p the periods  for p and p are and respectively that is pl and p  the  processil g times are t for p and t for p the deadline for each  process requires that it complete its cpu burst by the start of its next period  we must first ask ourselves whether it is possible to schedule these tasks  so that each meets its deadlines if we measure the cpu utilization of a process  pi as the ratio of its burst to its period ti i pi the cpu utilization of p is  j  and that of p is  for a total cpu utilization of  percent therefore it seems we can schedule these tasks in such a way that  both meet their deadlines and still leave the cpu with available cycles  first suppose we assign p a higher priority than p the execution of p  and p is shown in figure as we can see p starts execution first and  completes at time at this point p starts it completes its cpu burst at time   however the first deadline for p was at time so the scheduler has  caused p to miss its deadline  now suppose we use rate monotonic scheduling in which we assign p  a higher priority than p since the period of p is shorter than that of p  deadlines       figure scheduling of tasks when p has a higher priority than p   chapter  deadlines         figure rate monotonic scheduling  the execution of these processes is shown in figure p starts first and  completes its cpu burst at time thereby meeting its first deadline p starts  running at this point and runs until time at this time it is preempted by  p although it still has milliseconds remaining in its cpu burst p completes  its cpu burst at time at which point the scheduler resumes p p completes  its cpu burst at time also meeting its first deadline the system is idle until  time when p is scheduled again  rate monotonic scheduling is considered optimal in that if a set of  processes cannot be scheduled by this algorithm it cannot be scheduled by  any other algorithm that assigns static priorities let s next examine a set  of processes that cannot be scheduled using the rate monotonic algorithm  assume that process p has a period of p and a cpu burst of t   for p the corresponding values are p and t  rate monotonic  scheduling would assign process p a higher priority as it has the shorter  period the total cpu utilization of the two processes is   j   and it therefore seems logical that the two processes could be scheduled and still  leave the cpu with percent available time figure shows the scheduling  of processes p and p initially p runs until it completes its cpu burst at  time process p then begins running and n ms until time when it is  preempted by p at this point p still has milliseconds remaining in its  cpu burst process p n ms until time consequently p misses the deadline  for completion of its cpu burst at time  despite being optimal then rate monotonic scheduling has a limitation  cpu utilization is bounded and it is not always possible to fully maximize cpu  resources the worst case cpu utilization for scheduling n processes is     with one process in the system cpu utilization is percent but it falls to  approximately percent as the number of processes approaches infinity with  two processes cpu utilization is bounded at about percent combined cpu  utilization for the two processes scheduled in figures and is percent  therefore the rate monotonic scheduling algorithm is guaranteed to schedule  deadlines         figure missing deadlines with rate monotonic scheduling    them so that they can meet their deadlines for the two processes scheduled in  figure combined cpu utilization is approximately percent therefore  rate monotonic scheduling cannot guarantee that they can be scheduled so  that they meet their deadlines   earliest deadline first scheduling  earliest deadline first edf scheduling dynamically assigns priorities accord\\xad ing to deadline the earlier the deadline the higher the priority the later the  deadline the lower the priority under the edf policy when a process becomes  runnable it must announce its deadline requirements to the system priorities  may have to be adjusted to reflect the deadline of the newly rmmable process  note how this differs from rate monotonic scheduling where priorities are  fixed  to illustrate edf scheduling we again schedule the processes shown in  figure which failed to meet deadline requirements under rate monotonic  scheduling recall that p has values of p and t and that p has  values of p and t  the edf scheduling of these processes is shown  in figure process p has the earliest deadline so its initial priority is  higher than that of process p• process p begins rmming at the end of the  cpu burst for p however whereas rate monotonic scheduling allows p to  preempt p at the beginning of its next period at time edf scheduling allows  process p to continue running p now has a higher priority than p because  its next deadline at time is earlier than that of p at time thus both  p and p meet their first deadlines process p again begins running at time  and completes its second cpu burst at time also meeting its second deadline  at time p begins ruming at this point only to be preempted by p at the  start of its next period at time p is preempted because p has an earlier  deadline time than p time at time p completes its cpu burst  and p resumes execution finishing at time and meeting its deadline as  well the system is idle until time when p is scheduled to run once again  unlike the rate monotonic algorithm edf scheduling does not require that  processes be periodic nor must a process require a constant amount of cpu  time per burst the only requirement is that a process amomce its deadline  to the scheduler when it becomes runnable the appeal of edf scheduling is  that it is theoretically optimal theoretically it can schedule processes so that  each process can meet its deadline requirements and cpu utilization will be   percent in practice however it is impossible to achieve this level of cpu  utilization due to the cost of context switching between processes and interrupt  handling  deadlines        figure earliest deadline first scheduling   chapter   proportional share scheduling  proportional share schedulers operate by allocating t shares among all  applications an application can receive n shares of timef thus ensuring that  the application will have n t of the total processor time as an examplef  assume that a total oft shares is to be divided among three processesf  af b f and c a is assigned share sf b is assigned sharesf and c is assigned   shares this scheme ensures that a will have percent o£ total processor  time b will have percent and c will have percent  proportional share schedulers must work in conjunction with an admission  control policy to guarantee that an application receives its allocated shares  of time an admission control policy will only admit a client requesting a  particular number of shares if sufficient shares are available in our current  example we have allocated   shares of the total of shares  if a new process d requested shares the admission controller would deny  d entry into the system   pthread scheduling  the posix standard also provides extensions for real time computing\\xad posix b in this section we cover some of the posix pthread api related  to scheduling real time threads pthreads defines two scheduling classes for  real time threads  sched fifo  sched rr  sched fifo schedules threads according to a first come first served policy  using a fifo queue as outlined in section  however there is no time slicing  among threads of equal priority therefore the highest priority real time thread  at the front of the fifo queue will be granted the cpu until it terminates  or blocks sched rr for round robin is sincilar to sched fifo except that  it provides time slicing among threads of equal priority pthreads provides  an additional scheduling class scheddther but its implementation is  undefined and system specific it may behave differently on different systems  the pthread api specifies the following two functions for getting and  setting the scheduling policy  pthread attr getsched policy pthread attr t attr int   policy  pthread attr setsched policy pthread attr t attr int  policy  the first parameter to both functions is a pointer to the set of attributes for  the thread the second parameter is either a pointer to an integer that is  set to the current scheduling policy for pthread attr getsched policy  or an integer value sched fifo sched rr or sched other for the  pthread attr setsched policy function both functions return non zero  values if an error occurs     include pthread h   include stdio h   define num threads  int main int argc char argv    int i policy  pthread t tid num threads  pthread attr t attr  i get the default attributes i  pthread attr init attr  i get the current scheduling

scheduling policy and then sets the  scheduling algorithm to scheddther  in this section we describe vxworks a popular real time operating system  providing hard real time support vxworks commercially developed by wind  river systems is widely used in automobiles consumer and industrial devices  and networking equipment such as switches and routers vxworks is also used  to control the two rovers spirit and opportunity that began exploring the  planet mars in  the organizationofvxworks is shown in figure vxworks is centered  on the wind microkernel recall from our discussion in section that  microkernels are designed so that the operating system kernel provides a bare  minimum of features additional utilities such as networking file systems  and graphics are provided in libraries outside of the kernel this approach  offers many benefits including minimizing the size of the kernel a desirable  feature for an embedded system requiring a small footprint  the wind microkernel supports the following basic features  processes the wind microkernel provides support for individual pro\\xad cesses and threads using the pthread api however similar to linux  vxworks does not distinguish between processes and threads instead  referring to both as tasks  embedded real time application  scheduling the wind microkernel provides two separate scheduling  models preemptive scheduling and nonpreemptive round robin schedul\\xad ing with different priority levels the scheduler also supports the posix  api for real time threads covered in section   interrupts the wind microkernel also manages interrupts to support  hard real time requirements interrupt and dispatch latency times are  bounded  interprocess communication the wind micro kernel provides both shared  memory and message passing as mechanisms for communication between  separate tasks it also allows tasks to communicate using a technique  known as pipes a mechanism that behaves in the same way as a fifo  queue but allows tasks to communicate by writing to a special fik the pipe  to protect data shared by separate tasks vxworks provides semaphores  and mutex locks with a priority inheritance protocol to prevent priority  mversion  outside the microkernet vxworks includes several component libraries  that provide support for posix java tcp ip networking and the like all  components are optionat allowing the designer of an embedded system  to customize the system according to its specific needs for example if  networking is not required the tcp ip library can be excluded from the image  of the operating system this strategy allows the operating system designer to   chapter   include only required features thereby minimizing the size or footprint of  the operating system  vxworks takes an interesting approach to memory management support\\xad ing two levels of virtual memory the first level which is quite simple allows  for control of the cache on a per page basis this policy enables an application  to specify certain pages as non cacheable when data are being shared by  separate tasks running on a multiprocessor architecture it is possible that  shared data can reside in separate caches local to individual processors unless  an architecture supports a cache coherency policy to ensure that the same  data residing in two caches will not be different such shared data should not  be cached and should instead reside only in main memory so that all tasks  maintain a consistent view of the data  the second level of virtual memory requires the optional virtual memory  component vxvmi figure  along with processor support for a memory\\xad management unit mmu when this optional component is loaded on a system  with an mmu vxworks allows a task to mark certain data areas as private a  data area marked as private may only be accessed by the task it belongs to  furthermore vxworks allows pages containing kernel code along with the  interrupt vector to be declared as read only this is useful as vxworks does  not distinguish between user and kernel modes all applications run in kernel  mode giving an application access to the entire address space of the system  a real time system is a computer system requiring that results arrive within  a deadline period results arriving after the deadline has passed are useless  many real time systems are embedded in consumer and industrial devices  there are two types of real time systems soft and hard real time systems  soft real time systems are the least restrictive assigning real time tasks higher  scheduling priority than other tasks hard real time systems must guarantee  that real time tasks are serviced within their deadline periods in addition to  strict timing requirements real time systems can further be characterized as  having only a single purpose and running on small inexpensive devices  to meet timing requirements real time operating systems must employ  various techniques the scheduler for a real time operating system must sup\\xad port a priority based algorithm with preemption furthermore the operating  system must allow tasks running in the kernel to be preempted in favor  of higher priority real time tasks real time operating systems also address  specific timing issues by minimizing both interrupt and dispatch latency  real time scheduling algorithms include rate monotonic and earliest\\xad deadline first scheduling rate monotonic scheduling assignb tasks that  require the cpu more often a higher priority than tasks that require the  cpu less often earliest deadline first scheduling assigns priority according  to upcoming deadlines the earlier the deadline the higher the priority  proportional share scheduling uses the technique of dividing up processor  time into shares and assigning each process a number of shares thus  guaranteeing each process its proportional share of cpu time the pthread api  provides various features for scheduling real time threads as well     explain why interrupt and dispatch latency times must be bounded in  a hard real time system   identify whether hard or soft real time scheduling is more appropriate  in the following environments  a thermostat in a household  b control system for a nuclear power plant  c fuel economy system in an automobile  d landing system in a jet airliner   consider two processes p and p where

could be implemented within the context of a proportional share  scheduler   under what circumstances is rate monotonic scheduling inferior to  earliest deadline first scheduling in meeting the

  in earlier chapters we generally concerned ourselves with how operating  systems handle conventional data such as text files programs binaries word\\xad processing documents and spreadsheets however operating systems may  have to handle other kinds of data as well a relatively recent trend in  technology is the incorporation of multimedia data into computer systems  multimedia data consist of continuous media audio and video data as well  as conventional files continuous media data differ from conventional data  in that continuous media data such as frames of video must be delivered   streamed according to certain time restrictions for example frames per  second in this chapter we explore the demands of continuous media data  we also discuss in more detail how such data differ from conventional data  and how these differences affect the design of operating systems that support  the requirements of multimedia systems  chapter objectives  • to identify the characteristics of multimedia data  • to examine several algorithms used to compress multimedia data  • to explore the operating system requirements of multimedia data includ\\xad ing cpu and disk scheduling and network management   what is multimedia  the term multimedia describes a wide range of applications that are in  popular use today these include audio and video files such as mp audio  files dvd movies and short video clips of movie previews or news stories  downloaded over the internet multimedia applications also include live  web casts broadcast over the world wide web of speeches or sporting  events and even live webcams that allow a viewer in manhattan to observe  customers at a cafe in paris multimedia applications need not be either audio  or video rather a multimedia application often includes a combination of  both for example a movie may consist of separate audio and video tracks     chapter  nor must multimedia applications be delivered only to desktop personal  computers increasingly they are being directed toward smaller devices  including personal digital assistants pdas and cellular telephones for  example a stock trader may have stock quotes delivered in real time to her  pda  in this section we explore several characteristics of multimedia systems  and examine how multimedia files can be delivered from a server to a client  system we also look at common standards for representing multimedia video  and audio files   media delivery  multimedia data are stored in the file system just like any other data the major  difference between a regular file and a multimedia file is that the multimedia file  must be accessed at a specific rate whereas accessing the regular file requires  no special timing let s use video as an example of what we mean by rate  video is represented by a series of images formally known as that  are displayed in rapid succession the faster the frames are displayed the  smoother the video appears in general a rate of to frames per second is  necessary for video to appear smooth to human eyes the eye retains the image  of each frame for a short time after it has been presented a characteristic known  as a rate of to frames per second is fast enough  to appear continuous a rate lower than frames per second will result in  a choppy looking presentation the video file must be accessed from the file  system at a rate consistent with the rate at which the video is being  we refer to data with associated rate requirements as  multimedia data may be delivered to a client either from the local file  system or from a remote server when the data are delivered from the local file  system we refer to the delivery as examples include watching  a dvd on a laptop computer or listening to an mp audio file on a handheld  mp player in these cases the data comprise a regular file that is stored on  the local file system and played back that is viewed or listened to from that  system  multimedia files may also be stored on a remote server and delivered to a  client across a network using a technique known as a client may be  a personal computer or a smaller device such as a handheld computer pda or  cellular telephone data from live continuous media such as live webcams   are also streamed from a server to clients  there are two types of streaming techniques progressive download and  real time streaming with a download a media file containing  audio or video is downloaded and stored on the client s local file system as  the file is being downloaded the client is able to play back the media file  without having to wait for the file to be downloaded in its entirety because  the media file is ultimately stored on the client system progressive download  is most useful for relatively small media files such as short video clips  differs from progressive download in that the media  file is streamed to the client but is only played and not stored by the client  because the media file is not stored on the client system real time streaming  is preferable to progressive download for media files that might be too large    for storage on the system such as long videos and internet radio and tv  broadcasts  both progressive download and real time streaming may allow a client to  move to different points in the stream just as you can use the fast forward and  rewind operations on a dvd controller to move to different points in the dvd  disc for example we could move to the end of a minute streaming video or  replay a certain section of a movie clip the ability to move around within the  media stream is known as  two types of real time streaming are available live streaming and on\\xad demand streaming is used to deliver an event such as a concert  or a lecture live as it is actually occurring a radio program broadcast over the  internet is an example of a live real time stream in fact one of the authors of  this text regularly listens to a favorite radio station from vermont while at his  home in utah as it is streamed live over the internet live real time streaming is  also used for applications such as live webcams and video conferencing due to  its live delivery this type of real time streaming does not allow clients random  access to different poil ts in the media stream in addition live delivery means  that a client who wishes to view or listen to a particular live stream already  in progress will join the session late thereby missing earlier portions of  the stream the same thing happens with a live tv or radio broadcast if you  start watching the p m news at p m you will have missed the first  minutes of the broadcast  on demand streaming is used to deliver media streams such as full length  movies and archived lectures the difference between live and on demand  streaming is that on demand streaming does not take place as the event is  occurring thus for example whereas watching a live stream is like watching  a news broadcast on tv watching an on demand stream is like viewing a movie  on a dvd player at some convenient time there is no notion of arriving late  depending on the type of on demand streaming a client may or may not have  random access to the stream  examples of well known streaming media products include realplayer  apple quicktime and windows media player these products include both  servers that stream the media and client media players that are used for  playback   characteristics of multimedia systems  the demands of multimedia systems are unlike the demands of traditional  applications in general multimedia systems may have the following charac\\xad teristics  multimedia files can be quite large for example a minute mpeg  video file requires approximately gb of storage space minutes  of high defuution television hdtv requires approximately gb of  storage a server storing hundreds or thousands of digital video files  may thus require several terabytes of storage  continuous media may require very high data rates consider digital  video in which a frame of color video is displayed at a resolution of   x if we use bits to represent the color of each pixel which  allows us to have or roughly million different colors a single   chapter   frame requires x x  bits of data if the frames are  displayed at a rate of frames per second a bandwidth in excess of  mbps is required  multimedia applications are sensitive to timing delays during playback  once a continuous media file is delivered to a client delivery must  continue at a certain rate during playback of the media otherwise the  listener or viewer will be subjected to pauses during the presentation   operating system issues  for a computer system to deliver continuous media data it must guarantee  the specific rate and timing requirements also known as of  or qos requirements of continuous media  providing these qos guarantees affects several components in a com\\xad puter system and influences such operating system issues as cpu scheduling  disk scheduling and network management specific examples include the  following  compression and decoding may require significant cpu processing  multimedia tasks must be scheduled with certain priorities to ensure  meeting the deadline requirements of continuous media  similarly file systems must be efficient to meet the rate requirements of  continuous media  network protocols must support bandwidth requirements while mini\\xad mizing delay and jitter which we discuss further later in the chapter  in later sections we explore these and several other issues related to qos  first however we provide an overview of various techniques for compressing  multimedia data as suggested above compression makes significant demands  on the cpu  because of the size and rate requirements of multimedia systems multimedia  files are often compressed from their original form to a much smaller form  once a file has been compressed it takes up less space for storage and can be  delivered to a client more quickly compression is particularly important when  the content is beilcg streamed across a network cormection in discussing file  compression we often refer to the which is the ratio of the  original file size to the size of the compressed file for example an kb file  that is compressed to kb has a compression ratio of  once a file has been compressed encoded it must be decompressed  before it can be accessed a feature of the algorithm used to compress  the file affects the later decompression compression algorithms are classified  as either or with lossy compression some of the original data  are lost when the file is decoded whereas lossless compression ensures that    the compressed file can always be restored to its original form in generat  lossy techniques provide much higher cone pression ratios obviously though  only certain types of data can tolerate lossy compression namely images  audio and video lossy compression algorithms often work by eliminating  certain data such as very high or low frequencies that a human ear cannot  detect some lossy compression algorithms used on video operate by storing  only the differences between successive frames lossless algorithms are used  for compressing text files such as computer programs for example  files because we want to restore these compressed files to their state  a number of different lossy compression schemes for continuous media  data are commercially available in this section we cover one used by the  moving picture experts group better known as mpeg  mpeg refers to a set of file formats and compression standards for digital  video because digital video often contains an audio portion as well each of the  standards is divided into three layers layers and apply to the audio and  video portions of the media file layer known as the layer contains  timing information to allow the mpeg player to multiplex the audio and video  portions so that they are synchronized during playback there are three major  mpeg standards mpeg mpeg and mpeg  mpeg is used for digital video and its associated audio stream the  resolution of mpeg is x at frames per second with a bitrate of up to   mbps this provides a quality slightly lower than that of conventional vcr  videos mp audio files a popular medium for storing music use the audio  layer layer of mpeg for video mpeg can achieve a compression ratio of  up to although in practice compression ratios are much lower because  mpeg does not require high data rates it is often used to download short  video clips over the internet  mpeg provides better quality than mpeg and is used for compressing  dvd movies and digital television including high definition television or  hdtv mpeg identifies a number of levels and profiles of video compression  the refers to the resolution of the video the characterizes the  video s quality in general the higher the level of resolution and the better  the quality of the video the higher the required data rate typical bit rates  for mpeg encoded files are mbps to mbps because mpeg requires  higher rates it is often suitable for delivery of video across a network and  is generally used for local playback  mpeg is the most recent of the standards and is used to transmit  audio video and graphics including two dimensional and three dimensional  animation layers animation makes it possible for end users to interact with  the file during playback for example a potential home buyer can download  an mpeg file and take a virtual tour through a home she is considering  purchasing moving from room to room as she chooses another appealing  feature of mpeg is that it provides a scalable level of quality allowing delivery  over relatively slow network connections such as i bps modems or over  high speed local area networks with rates of several megabits per second  furthermore by providing a scalable level of quality mpeg audio and video  files can be delivered to wireless devices including handheld computers pdas  and cell phones  all three mpeg standards discussed here perform lossy compression  to achieve high compression ratios the fundamental idea behind mpeg   chapter   compression is to store the differences between successive frames we do not  cover further details of how mpeg performs compression but rather encourage  the interested reader to consult the bibliographical notes at the end of this  chapter  as a result of the characteristics described in section  multimedia  applications often require levels of service from the operating system that differ  from the requirements of traditional applications such as word processors  compilers and spreadsheets tin ing and rate requirements are perhaps the  issues of foremost concern as the playback of audio and video data demands  that the data be delivered within a certain deadline and at a continuous  fixed rate traditional applications typically do not have such time and rate  constraints  tasks that request data at constant intervals or known as  for example an mpeg video might require a rate of  frames per second during playback maintaining this rate requires that a frame  be delivered approximately every l h or hundredths of a second to  put this in the context of deadlines let s assume that frame f succeeds frame  fi in the video playback and that frame fi was displayed at time t the  deadline for displaying frame f i is hundredths of a second after time t if  the operating system is unable to display the frame by this deadline the frame  will be omitted from the stream  as mentioned earlier rate requirements and deadlines are known as quality  of service qos requirements there are three qos levels  the system makes a best effort attempt to satisfy the  requirements however no guarantees are made  this level treats different types of traffic in different ways giving  certain traffic streams higher priority than other streams however just  as with best effort service no guarantees are made  the quality of service requirements are guaranteed  traditional operating systems the systems we have discussed in this  text so far typically provide only best effort service and rely on that is they simply assume that the total amount of resources  available will tend to be larger than a worst case workload would demand if  demand exceeds resource capacity manual intervention must take place and  a process or several processes must be removed from the system however  next generation multimedia systems cannot make such assumptions these  systems must provide continuous media applications with the guarantees  made possible by hard qos therefore in the remainder of this discussion  when we refer to qos we mean hard qos next we explore various techniques  that enable multimedia systems to provide such service level guarantees  there are a number of parameters defining qos for multimedia applica\\xad tions including the following    throughput is the total amount of work done during a certain  interval for multimedia applications throughput is the required data rate   delay refers to the elapsed time from when a request is first  submitted to when the desired result is produced for example the time  from when a client requests a media stream to when the stream is delivered  is the delay  jitter is related to delay but whereas delay refers to the time a  client must wait to receive a stream jitter refers to delays that occur  during playback of the stream certain multimedia applications such  as on demand real time streaming can tolerate this sort of delay jitter  is generally considered unacceptable for continuous media applications  however because it may mean long pauses or lost frames during  playback clients can often compensate for jitter by buffering a certain  amount of data say seconds worth before beginning playback  reliability refers to how errors are handled during transmis\\xad sion and processing of continuous media errors may occur due to lost  packets in the network or processing delays by the cpu in these and  other scenarios errors cannot be corrected since packets typically arrive  too late to be useful  the quality of service may be between the client and the server  for example continuous media data may be compressed at different levels of  quality the higher the quality the higher the required data rate a client may  negotiate a specific data rate with a server thus agreeing to a certain level of  quality during playback furthermore many media players allow the client  to configure the player according to the speed of the client s connection to  the network this allows a client to receive a streaming service at a data rate  specific to a particular connection thus the client is negotiating quality of  service with the content provider  to provide qos guarantees operating systems often use  which is simply the practice of admitting a request for service only if the server  has sufficient resources to satisfy the request we see admission control quite  often in our everyday lives for example a movie theater only admits as  many customers as it has seats in the theater there are also many situations in  everyday life where admission control is not practiced but would be desirable  if no admission control policy is used in a multimedia environment the  demands on the system might become so great that the system becomes unable  to meet its qos guarantees  in chapter we discussed using semaphores as a method of implementing  a simple admission control policy in this scenario there exist a finite number  of nonshareable resources when a resource is requested we grant the request  only if sufficient resources are available otherwise the requesting process must  wait until a resource becomes available we can use semaphores to implement  an admission control policy by first initializing a semaphore to the number of  resources available every request for a resource is made through a wait  operation on the semaphore a resource is released with an invocation of  signal on the semaphore once all resources are in use subsequent calls to  wait block until there is a corresponding signal   chapter   figure resources on a file server  a common technique for implementing admission control is to use  for example resources on a file server may include  the cpu memory file system devices and network figure  note that  resources may be either exclusive or shared and that there may be either  single or multiple instances of each resource type to use a resource a client  must make a reservation request for the resource il advance if the request  cannot be granted the reservation is denied an admission control scheme  assigns a to each type of resource requests for resources  have associated qos requirements for example required data rates when a  request for a resource arrives the resource manager determines if the resource  can meet the qos demands of the request if it cannot the request may  be rejected or a lower level of qos may be negotiated between the client  and the server if the request is accepted the resource manager reserves the  resources for the requesting client thus assuring the client that the desired qos  requirements will be met in section  we examine the admission control  algorithm used to ensure qos guarantees in the cineblitz multimedia storage  server   which covers real time systems we distinguished between  and soft real time systems  simply give scheduling priority to critical processes a soft real time system  ensures that a critical process will be given preference over a noncritical process  but provides no guarantee as to when the critical process will be scheduled  a typical requirement of continuous media however is that data must be  delivered to a client by a certain deadline data that do not arrive by the deadline  are unusable multimedia systems thus require hard real time scheduling to  ensure that a critical task will be serviced withii a guaranteed period of time     another scheduling issue concerns whether a scheduling algorithm uses  or distinction first discussed in chapter   the difference between the two is that the priority of a process will remain  unchanged if the scheduler assigns it a static priority scheduling algorithms  that assign dynamic priorities allow priorities to change over time most  operating systems use dynamic priorities when scheduling non real time tasks  with the intention of giving higher priority to interactive processes however  when scheduling real time tasks most systems assign static priorities as the  design of the scheduler is less complex  several of the real time scheduling strategies discussed in section can  be used to meet the rate and deadline qos requirements of continuous media  applications  we first discussed disk scheduling in chapter there we focused primarily  on systems that handle conventional data for these systems the scheduling  goals are fairness and throughput as a result most traditional disk schedulers  employ some form of the scan section  or c scan section   algorithn l  continuous media files however have two constraints that conventional  data files generally do not have timing deadlines and rate requirements  these two constraints must be satisfied to preserve qos guarantees and disk\\xad scheduling algorithms must be optimized for the constraints unfortunately  these two constraints are often in conflict continuous media files typically  require very high disk bandwidth rates to satisfy their data rate requirements  because disks have relatively low transfer rates and relatively high latency  rates disk schedulers must reduce the latency times to ensure high bandwidth  however reducing latency times may result in a scheduling policy that does  not prioritize according to deadlines in this section we explore two disk\\xad scheduling algorithms that meet the qos requirements for continuous media  systems   earliest deadline first scheduling  we first presented the earliest deadline first edf algorithm in section  as  an example of a cpu scheduling algorithm that assigns priorities according to  deadlines edf can also be used as a disk scheduling algorithm in this context  edf uses a queue to order requests according to the time each request must  be completed its deadline edf is similar to shortest seek time first sstf  discussed in section  except that instead of servicing the request closest  to the current cylinder we service requests according to deadline the request  with the closest deadline is serviced first  a problem with this approach is that servicing requests strictly according  to deadline may result in higher seek tim es since the disk heads may move  randomly throughout the disk without any regard to their current position  for example suppose a disk head is currently at cylinder and the queue  of cylinders ordered according to deadlines is  under strict edf  scheduling the disk head will move from to to and then back to   chapter   note that the head passes over cylinder as it travels from to it  is possible that the disk scheduler could have serviced the request for cylinder   en route to cylinder and still preserved the deadline requirement for  cylinder   scan edf scheduling  the fundamental problem with strict edf scheduling is that it ignores the  position of the read write heads of the disk it is possible that the heads will  wildly to and fro across the disk leading to unacceptable seek times  that negatively affect disk throughput recall that this is the same issue faced  with fcfs scheduling section  in the context of cpu scheduling we can  address this issue by adopting scan the disk arm moves  in one direction across the disk servicing requests according to their proximity  to the current cylinder once the disk arm reaches the end of the disk it begins  moving in the reverse direction this strategy optimizes seek times  scan edf is a hybrid algorithm that combines edf with scan scheduling  scan edf starts with edf ordering but services requests with the same deadline  scan order what if several requests have different deadlines that are  relatively close together in this case scan edf may batch requests usil g  scan ordering to service requests in the same batch there are many techniques  for batching requests with similar deadlines the only requirement is that  reordering requests within a batch must not prevent a request from being  serviced by its deadline if deadlines are equally distributed batches can be  organized in groups of a certain size say requests per batch  another approach is to batch requests whose deadlines fall within a given  time threshold say milliseconds let s consider an example in which we  batch requests in this way  be ordered according to scan order thus in batch we will first service  request f and then request d note that we are moving downward in cylinder  in batch we first service request a then the heads  begin moving upward in cylinders servicing requests hand then g batch  is serviced in the order e b j requests i and care serviced in the final batch  perhaps the foremost qos issue with multimedia systems concerns preserving  rate requirements for example if a client wishes to view a video compressed  with mpeg the quality of service greatly depends on the system s ability to  deliver the frames at the required rate  our coverage of issues such as cpu and disk scheduling algorithms has  focused on how these techniques can be used to better meet the quality of\\xad service requirements of multimedia applications however if the media file is  being streamed over a network perhaps the internet issues relating to how  the network delivers the multimedia data can also significantly affect how qos  demands are met in this section we explore several network issues related to  the unique demands of continuous media  before we proceed it is worth noting that computer networks in general   and the internet in particular currently do not provide network protocols  that can ensure the delivery of data with timing requirements there are  some proprietary protocols notably those running on cisco routers that  do allow certain network traffic to be prioritized to meet qos requirements  such proprietary protocols are not generalized for use across the internet and  therefore do not apply to our discussion  when data are routed across a network it is likely that the transmission  will encounter congestion delays and other network traffic issues issues  that are beyond the control of the originator of the data for multimedia data  with timing requirements any timing issues must be synchronized between  the end hosts the server delivering the content and the client playing it back  one protocol that addresses timing issues is the rtp is an internet standard for delivering real time data  including audio and video it can be used for transporting media formats  such as mp audio files and video files compressed using mpeg rtf does not  provide any qos guarantees it provides features that allow a receiver  to remove jitter introduced by delays and congestion in the network  in following sections we consider two other approaches for handling the  unique requirements of continuous media   unicasting and multicasting  in general there are three methods for delivering content from a server to a  client across a network  the server delivers the content to a single client if the content  is being delivered to more than one client the server must establish a  separate unicast for each client  the server delivers the content to all clients regardless of  whether they wish to receive the content or not  the server delivers the content to a group of receivers that  indicate they wish to receive the content this method lies somewhere  between unicasting and broadcasting  an issue with unicast delivery is that the server must establish a separate  unicast session for each client this seems especially wasteful for live real time  streaming where the server must make several copies of the same content one  for each client obviously broadcasting is not always appropriate as not all  clients may wish to receive the stream suffice it to say that broadcasting is  typically only used across local area networks and is not possible across the  public internet  multicasting appears to be a reasonable compromise since it allows the  server to deliver a single copy of the content to all clients indicating that they  wish to receive it the difficulty with multicasting from a practical standpoint is  that the clients must be physically close to the server or to intermediate routers  that relay the content from the originating server if the route from the server  to the client must cross intermediate routers the routers must also support  multicasting if these conditions are not met the delays incurred during routing  may result in violation of the timing requirements of the continuous media in  the worst case if a client is connected to an intermediate router that does not  support multicasting the client will be unable to receive the multicast stream  at all  currently most streaming media are delivered across unicast channels  however multicasting is used in various areas where the organization of  the server and clients is known in advance for example a corporation with  several sites across a country may be able to ensure that all sites are connected  to multicasting routers and are within reasonable physical proximity to the  routers the organization will then be able to deliver a presentation from the  chief executive officer using multicasting   real time streaming protocol  in section  we described some features of streaming media as we noted  there users may be able to randomly access a media stream perhaps replaying  or pausing as they would with a dvd controller how is this possible  to answer this question let s consider how streaming media are delivered  to clients one approach is to stream the media from a standard web server  using the hypertext transport protocol or http the protocol used to deliver  documents from a web server quite often clients use a such  as quicktime windows media player to play media  streamed from a standard web server typically the client first requests a  which contains the location of the streaming media file this metafile is delivered to the  client s web browser and the browser then starts the appropriate media player  according to the type of media specified by the metafile for example a real  audio stream would require the realplayer while the windows media player  would be used to play back streaming windows media the media player  then contacts the web server and requests the streaming media the stream    figure streaming media from a conventional web server  is delivered from the web server to the media player using standard http  requests this process is outlined in figure  the problem with delivering streaming media from a standard web server  is that http is considered a protocol thus a web server does not  maintain the state or status of its connection with a client as a result it is  difficult for a client to pause during the delivery of streaming media content  since pausing would require the web server to know where in the stream to  begin when the client wished to resume playback  an alternative strategy is to use a specialized streaming server that  is designed specifically for streaming media one protocol designed for  communication between streaming servers and media players is known as the  or the significant advantage rtsp provides  over http is a connection between the client and the server which  allows the client to pause or seek to random positions in the stream during  playback delivery of streaming media using rtsp is similar to delivery using  http figure in that the metafile is delivered using a conventional web  server however rather than a web server media is delivered  from a streaming server using the rtsp protocol the operation of rtsp is shown  in figure  rtsp defines several commands as part of its protocol these commands  are sent from a client to an rtsp streaming server  the server allocates resources for a client session  the server delivers a stream to a client session established from a  setup command  the server suspends delivery of a stream but maintains the  resources for the session  the server breaks down the connection and frees up resources  allocated for the session   chapter   figure real time streaming protocol rtsp  the commands can be illustrated with a state machine for the server as shown  in figure as you can see in the figure the rtsp server may be in one of  three states and transitions between these three states are  triggered when the server receives one of the rtsp commands from the client  using rtsp rather than http for streaming media offers several other  advantages but they are primarily related to networking issues and are  therefore beyond the scope of this text we encourage interested readers to  consult the bibliographical notes at the end of this chapter for sources of further  information  the cineblitz multimedia storage server is a high performance media server  that supports both continuous media with rate requirements such as video  and audio and conventional data with no associated rate requirements such  as text and images cineblitz refers to clients with rate requirements as  whereas have no rate constraints cine blitz  guarantees to meet the rate requirements of real time clients by implementing  an admission controller admitting a client only if there are sufficient resources  to allow data retrieval at the required rate in this section we explore the  setup play  tear down pause  figure finite state machine representing rtsp  disk scheduling  the cineblitz disk scheduler services requests in at the beginning of  each service cycle requests are placed inc scan section  recall  from our earlier discussions of c scan that the disk heads move from one end  of the disk to the other however rather than reversing direction when they  reach the end of the disk as in pure scan disk scheduling section  the  the admission control algorithm in must monitor requests from  both real time and non real time clients ensuring that both classes of clients  receive service furthermore the admission controller must provide the rate  guarantees required by real time clients to ensure fairness only a fraction p of  time is reserved for real time clients while the remainder p is set aside for  non real time clients here we explore the admission controller for real time  clients only thus the term client refers to a real time client  the admission controller in cineblitz monitors various system resources  such as disk bandwidth and disk latency while keeping track of available  buffer space the cineblitz admission controller admits a client only if there  is enough available disk bandwidth and buffer space to retrieve data for the  client at its required rate  cineblitz queues requests for continuous media files where  r r r  r are the requests and r is the required data rate for a  given request r requests in the queue are served in cyclic order in rounds of  time length t t being tpically measured in seconds the scheme is using a  technique known as double wherein a buffer is allocated for each of another causing two blocks to be retrieved we know that the retrieval of  a disk block involves a a seek to the track contailling the block and b the  rotational delay as the data in the desired track arrive under the disk head as  described cineblitz uses a c scan disk scheduling algorithm so disk blocks  are retrieved in the sorted order of their positions on the disk  multimedia applications are in common use in modern computer systems  multimedia files include video and audio filesf which may be delivered  to systems such as desktop computersf personal digital assistantsf and cell  phones the primary distinction between multimedia data and conventional  data is that multimedia data have specific rate and deadline requiren ents  because multimedia files have specific timing requirementsf the data must  often be compressed before

modern oper\\xad ating system from microsoft for intel pentium and later microprocessors  it is compatible with ms dos and microsoft windows applications    this chapter presents an in depth examination of the linux operating system  by exam ining a complete real system we can see how the concepts we have  discussed relate both to one another and to practice  linux is a version of unix that has gained popularity in recent years in this  chapter we look at the history and development of linux and cover the user  and programmer interfaces that linux presents interfaces that owe a great  deal to the unix tradition we also discuss the internal methods by which linux  implements these interfaces linux is a rapidly evolving operating system  this chapter describes developments through the linux kernel which was  released in late  to explore the history of the unix operating system from which linux is  derived and the principles upon which linux is designed  to examine the linux process model and illustrate how linux schedules  processes and provides interprocess communication  to look at memory management in linux  to explore how linux implements file systems and manages devices  linux looks and feels much like any other unix system indeed unix  compatibility has been a major design goal of the linux project however  linux is much younger than most unix systems its development began in   when a finnish student linus torvalds wrote and christened linux  a small but self contained kernel for the processor the first true bit  processor in intel s range of pc compatible cpus  early in its development the linux source code was made available free  on the internet as a result linux s history has been one of collaboration by  many users from all around the world corresponding almost exclusively over  the internet from an initial kernel that partially implemented a small subset of     chapter  the unix system services the linux system has grown to include much unix  functionality  in its early days linux development revolved largely around the central  operating system kernel the core privileged executive that n anages all  system resources and that interacts directly with the computer hardware  we need much more than this kernel to produce a full operating systeitl  o£ course it is useful to make the distinction between the linux kernel and  a linux system the is an entirely original piece of software  developed from scratch by the linux con munity the as we  know it today includes a multitude of components some written from scratch  others borrowed from other development projects and still others created in  collaboration with other teams  the basic linux system is a standard environment for applications and  user programming but it does not enforce any standard means of managing  the available functionality as a whole as linux has matured a need has arisen  for another layer of functionality on top of the linux system this need has  been met by various linux distributions a includes all the  standard components of the linux system plus a set of administrative tools  to simplify the initial installation and subsequent upgrading of linux and to  manage installation and removal of other packages on the system a modern  distribution also typically includes tools for management of file systems  creation and management of user accounts administration of networks web  browsers word processors and so on   the linux kernel  the first linux kernel released to the public was version dated may   it had no networking ran only on compatible intel processors  and pc hardware and had extremely limited device driver support the virtual  memory subsystem was also fairly basic and included no support for memory\\xad mapped files however even this early incarnation supported shared pages  with copy on write the only file system supported was the minix file system   the first linux kernels were cross developed on a minix platform however  the kernel did implement proper unix processes with protected address spaces  the next milestone version linux was released on march   this release culminated three years of rapid development of the limlx kernel  perhaps the single biggest new feature was networking included support  for unix s standard tcp lip networking protocols as well as a bsd compatible  socket interface for networking programming device driver support was  added for running ip over an ethernet or using ppp or slip protocols over  serial lines or modems  the kernel also included a new much enhanced file system without the  limitations of the original minix file system and supported a range of scsi con\\xad trollers for high performance disk access the developers extended the virtual  memory subsystem to support paging to swap files and memory mapping of  arbitrary files but only read only memory mapping was implemented in   a range of extra hardware support was also included in this release  although still restricted to the intel pc platform hardware support had grown  to include floppy disk and cd rom devices as well as sound cards a range  of mice and international keyboards floating point emulation was provided    in the kernel for users who had no math coprocessor system  v unix style inclllding shared memory  semaphores and message queues was implemented simple support for  dynamically loadable and unloadable kernel modules was supplied as well  at this point development started on the kernel stream but numerous  bug fix patches were released subsequently against a pattern was adopted  as the standard numbering convention for linux kernels kernels with an odd  minor version number such as  and are even  numbered minor version numbers are stable updates  against the stable kernels are intended only as remedial versions whereas the  development kernels may include newer and relatively untested functionality  in march the kernel was released this release did not offer  nearly the same improvement in functionality as the release but it did  support a much wider variety of hardware including the new pci hardware  bus architecture developers added another pc specific feature support for  the cpu s virtual mode to allow emulation of the dos operating  system for pc computers they also updated the networking stack to provide  support for the ipx protocol and made the ip implementation more complete  by including accounting and firewalling functionality  the kernel was the final pc only linux kernel the source distribution  for linux included partially implemented support for sparc alpha and  mips cpus but full integration of these other architectures did not begin until  after the stable kernel was released  the linux release concentrated on wider hardware support and more  complete implementations of existing functionality much new functionality  was under development at the time but integration of the new code into the  main kernel source code had been deferred until after the stable kernel had  been released as a result the development stream saw a great deal of new  functionality added to the kernel  this work was finally released as linux in jmce this release  was given a major version number increment on account of two major new  capabilities support for multiple architectures including a bit native alpha  port and support for multiprocessor architectures linux distributions based  on are also available for the motorola series processors and for  sun s sparc systems a derived version of linux running on top of the mach  microkernel also runs on pc and powermac systems  the changes in did not stop there the memory management code  was substantially improved to provide a unified cache for file system data  independent of the caching of block devices as a result of this change the  kernel offered greatly increased file system and virtual memory performance  for the first time file system caching was extended to networked file systems  and writable memory mapped regions also were supported  the kernel also included much improved tcp ip performance and a  number of new networking protocols were added including apple talk ax  an lateur radio networking and isdn support the ability to mount remote  netware and smb microsoft lanmanager network volumes was added  other major improvements in were support for internal kernel threads  for handling dependencies between loadable modules and for automatic  loading of modules on demand dynamic configuration of the kernel at run  time was much improved through a new standardized configuration interface   chapter  additional new features included file system quotas and posix compatible  real time process scheduling classes  improvements continued with the release of linux in january a  port for ultrasparc systems was added networking was enhanced with more  flexible firewalling better routing and traffic management and support for  tcp large window and selective acks acorn apple and nt disks could now  be read and nfs was enhanced and a kernel mode nfs daemon added signal  handling interrupts and some i were locked at a finer level than before to  improve symmetric multiprocessor smp performance  advances in the and releases of the kernel include increased support  for smp systems journaling file systems and enhancements to the memory\\xad management system the process scheduler was modified in version  providing an efficient scheduling algorithm in addition the limix  kernel is now preemptive allowing a process to be preempted while running  in kernel mode   the linux system  in many ways the linux kernel forms the core of the linux project but other  components make up the complete linux operating system whereas the linux  kernel is composed entirely of code written from scratch specifically for the  linux project much of the supporting software that makes up the linux  system is not exclusive to linux but is common to a number of unix like  operating systems in particular linux uses many tools developed as part  of berkeley s bsd operating system mit s x window system and the free  software foundation s gnu project  this sharing of tools has worked in both directions the main system  libraries of linux were originated by the gnu project but the linux community  greatly improved the libraries by addressing omissions li efficiencies and  bugs other components such as the l were already  of sufficiently high quality to be used directly in linux the networking\\xad administration tools under linux were derived from code first developed for   bsd but more recent bsd derivatives such as freebsd have borrowed code  from linux in return examples include the intel floating point emulation math  library and the pc sound hardware device drivers  the linux system as a whole is maintained by a loose network of  developers collaborating over the internet with small groups or individuals  having responsibility for maintaining the integrity of specific components  a small number of public internet file transfer protocol ftp archive sites  act as de facto standard repositories for these components the  document is also maintained by the linux community  as a means of ensuring compatibility across the various system components  this standard specifies the overall layout of a standard linux file system it  determines under which directory names configuration files libraries system  binaries and run time data files should be stored   linux distributions  in theory anybody can install a linux system by fetching the latest revisions  of the necessary system components from the ftp sites and compiling them  in linux s early days this operation was often precisely what a linux user    had to carry out as linux has matured however various individuals and  groups have attempted to make this job less painful by providing standard  precompiled sets of packages for easy installation  these collections or distributions include much more than just the  basic linux system they typically include extra system installation and  management utilities as well as precompiled and ready to install packages  of many of the common unix tools such as news servers web browsers  text processing and editing tools and even games  the first distributions managed these packages by simply providing  a means of unpacking all the files into the appropriate places one of  the important contributions of modem dish·ibutions however is advanced  package management today s linux distributions include a package tracking  database that allows packages to be installed upgraded or removed painlessly  the sls distribution dating back to the early days of linux was the first  collection of linux packages that was recognizable as a complete distribution  although it could be installed as a single entity sls lacked the package\\xad management tools now expected of linux distributions the  distribution represented a great improvement in overall quality even though  it also had poor package management in fact it is still one of the most widely  installed distributions in the linux community  since slackware s release many commercial and noncommercial limlx  distributions have become available and are particularly  popular distributions the first comes from a commercial linux support  company and the second from the free software linux community other  commercially supported versions of linux include distributions from cz ldera  and a large linux following in germany  has resulted in several dedicated german language distributions including  versions from and there are too many linux distributions in  circulation for us to list all of them here the variety of distributions does not  prohibit compatibility across linux distributions however the rpm package  file format is used or at least understood by the majority of distributions and  commercial applications distributed in this format can be installed and run on  any distribution that can accept rpm files   linux licensing  the linux kernel is distributed under the gnu general public license gpl  the terms of which are set out the free software fmmdation linux is not  public domain software implies that the authors have waived  copyright rights in the software but copyright rights in linux code are still  held by the code s various authors linux is free software however in the sense  that people can copy it modify it use it in any manner they want and give  away their own copies without any restrictions  the main implications of linux s licensing terms are that nobody using  liimx or creating a derivative of linux a legitimate exercise can make  the derived product proprietary software released under the gpl camwt be  redistributed as a binary only product if you release software that includes  any components covered by the gpl then under the gpl you must make  source code available alongside any binary distributions this resh·iction does   chapter   not prohibit ntaking or even selling binary only software distributions as  long as anybody who receives binaries is also given the opportunity to get  source code for a reasonable distribution charge  in its overall design linux resembles any other traditional nonmicrokernel  unix implementation it is a multiuser multitasking system with a full set  of unix compatible tools linux s file system adheres to traditional unix  semantics and the standard unix networking model is implemented fully  the internal details of linux s design have been influenced heavily by the  history of this operating system s development  although linux runs on a wide variety of platforms it was developed  exclusively on pc architecture a great deal of that early development was  carried out by individual enthusiasts rather than by well funded development  or research facilities so from the start linux attempted to squeeze as much  functionality as possible from limited resources today linux can run happily  on a multiprocessor machine with hundreds of megabytes of main memory  and many gigabytes of disk space but it is still capable of operating usefully  in under mb of ram  as pcs became more powerful and as memory and hard disks became  cheaper the original minimalist limix kernels grew to implement more  unix functionality speed and efficiency are still important design goals but  much recent and current work on linux has concentrated on a third major  design goal standardization one of the prices paid for the diversity of unix  implementations currently available is that source code written for one may not  necessarily compile or run correctly on another even when the same system  calls are present on two different unix systems they do not necessarily behave  in exactly the same way the posix standards comprise a set of specifications for  different aspects of operating system behavior there are posix documents for  common operating system functionality and for extensions such as process  threads and real time operations linux is designed to be compliant with  the relevant posix documents at least two linux distributions have achieved  official posix certification  because it gives standard interfaces to both the programmer and the user  linux presents few surprises to anybody familiar with unix we do not detail  these interfaces here the sections on the programmer interface section a  and user interface section a of bsd apply equally well to linux by default  the linux programming interface adheres to svr unix semantics  rather than to bsd behavior a separate set of libraries is available to implement  bsd semantics in places where the two behaviors differ significantly  many other standards exist in the unix world but full certification of  linux with respect to these standards is sometimes slowed because certification  is often available only for a fee and the expense involved in certifying an  operating system s compliance with most standards is substantial however  supporting a wide base of applications is important for any operating system  so implementation of standards is a major goal for linux development even  if the implementation is not formally certified in addition to the basic posix    standard linux currently supports the posix threading extensions pthreads   and a subset of the posix extensions for real time process control   components of a linux system  the linux system is composed of three main bodies of code in line with most  traditional unix implementations  kernel the kernel is responsible for maintaining all the important  abstractions of the operating system including such things as virtual  memory and processes  system libraries the system libraries define a standard set of functions  through which applications can interact with the kernel these functions  implement much of the operating system functionality that does not need  the full privileges of kernel code  system utilities the system utilities are programs that perform individ\\xad ual specialized management tasks some system utilities may be invoked  just once to initialize and configure some aspect of the system others\\xad known as daemons in unix terminology may run permanently handling  such tasks as responding to incoming network connections accepting  logon requests from terminals and updating log files  figure illustrates the various components that make up a full linux  system the most important distinction here is between the kernel and  everything else all the kernel code executes in the processor s privileged  mode with full access to all the physical resources of the computer linux  refers to this privileged mode as kernel under linux no user mode  code is built into the kernel any operating system support code that does not  need to run in kernel mode is placed into the system libraries instead  although various modern operating systems have adopted a message\\xad passing architecture for their kernel internals linux retains un lx s historical  model the kernel is created as a single monolithic binary the main reason is  to improve performance because all kernel code and data structures are kept  iil a single address space no context switches are necessary when a process  calls an operating system function or when a hardware interrupt is delivered  linux kernel  loadable kernel modules  figure components of the linux system   chapter  this single address space contains not only the core scheduling and virtual  memory code but all kernel code including all device drivers file systems and  networking code  even though all the kernel components share this same m elting pot there  is still room for modularity in the san e way that user applications can load  shared libraries at run time to pull in a needed piece of code so the linux  kernel can load and unload modules dynamically at run time the kernel  does not necessarily need to know in advance which modules may be loaded   they are truly independent loadable components  the linux kernel forms the core of the linux operating system it provides  all the functionality necessary to run processes and it provides system services  to give arbitrated and protected access to hardware resources the kernel  implements all the features required to qualify as an operating system on  its own however the operating system provided by the linux kernel looks  nothing like a unix system it is missing many of the extra features of unix  and the features that it does provide are not necessarily in the format in which  a unix application expects them to appear the operating system interface  visible to running applications is not maintained directly by the kernel rather  applications make calls to the system libraries which in turn call the operating\\xad system services as necessary  the system libraries provide many types of functionality at the simplest  level they allow applications to make kernel system service requests making  a system call involves transferring control from tmprivileged user mode to  privileged kernel mode the details of this transfer vary from architecture to  architecture the libraries take care of collecting the system call arguments and  if necessary arranging those arguments in the special form necessary to make  the system call  the libraries may also provide more complex versions of the basic system  calls for example the c language s buffered file handling functions are all  implemented in the system libraries providing more advanced control of file  i than the basic kernel system calls the libraries also provide routines that do  not correspond to system calls at all such as sorting algorithms mathematical  functions and string manipulation routines all the functions necessary to  support the running of unix or posix applications are implemented here in the  system libraries  the limix system includes a wide variety of user mode programs both  system utilities and user utilities the system utilities include all the programs  necessary to initialize the system such as those to configure network devices  and to load kernel modules continually running server programs also com t as  system utilities such programs handle user login requests incoming network  connections and the printer queues  not all the standard utilities serve key system administration functions  the unix user environment contains a large number of standard utilities to  do simple everyday tasks such as listing directories moving and deleting  files and displaying the contents of a file more complex utilities can perform  text processing functions such as sorting textual data and performing pattern  searches on input text together these utilities form a standard tool set that  users can expect on any unix system although they do not perform any  operating system function they are an important part of the basic limix  system     the linux kernel has the ability to load and unload arbitrary sections of kernel  code on demand these loadable kernel modules run in privileged kernel mode  and as a consequence have full access to all the hardware capabilities of the  machine on which they run in theory there is no restriction on what a kernel  module is allowed to do typically a module might implement a device driver  a file system or a networking protocol  kernel modules are convenient for several reasons linux s source code is  free so anybody wanting to write kernel code is able to compile a modified  kernel and to reboot to load that new functionality however recompiling  relinking and reloading the entire kernel is a cumbersome cycle to undertake  when you are developing a new driver if you use kernel modules you do not  have to make a new kernel to test a new driver the driver can be compiled  on its own and loaded into the already rmming kernel of course once a new  driver is written it can be distributed as a module so that other users can  benefit from it without having to rebuild their kernels  this latter point has another implication because it is covered by the  gpl license the linux kernel cannot be released with proprietary components  added to it unless those new components are also released under the gpl and  the source code for them is made available on demand the kernel s module  interface allows third parties to write and distribute on their own terms device  drivers or file systems that could not be distributed under the gpl  kernel modules allow a linux system to be set up with a standard minimal  kernet without any extra device drivers built in any device drivers that  the user needs can be either loaded explicitly by the system at startup or  loaded automatically by the system on demand and unloaded when not in  use for example a cd rom driver might be loaded when a cd is mounted  and unloaded from memory when the cd is dismounted from the file system  the module support under linux has three components  the allows modules to be loaded into memory and  to talk to the rest of the kernel  the allows modules to tell the rest of the kernel that  a new driver has become available  a allows different device drivers to  reserve hardware resources and to protect those resources from accidental  use by another driver   module management  loading a module requires more than just loading its binary contents into  kernel memory the system must also make sure that any references the  module makes to kernel symbols or entry points are updated to point to the  correct locations in the kernel s address space linux deals with this reference  updating by splitting the job of module loading into two separate sections the  management of sections of module code in kernel memory and the handling  of symbols that modules are allowed to reference   chapter  linux maintains an internal syncbol table in the kernel this symbol table  does not contain the full set of symbols defined in the kernel during the latter s  compilation rather a symbol must be exported explicitly by the kernel the set  of exported symbols constitutes a well defined interface by which a module  can interact with the kernel  although exporting symbols from a kernel function requires an explicit  request by the programmer no special effort is needed to import those symbols  into a module a module writer just uses the standard external linking of the  c language any external symbols referenced by the module but not declared  by it are simply marked as unresolved in the final module binary produced by  the compiler when a module is to be loaded into the kernel a system utility  first scans the module for these unresolved references all symbols that still  need to be resolved are looked up in the kernel s symbol table and the correct  addresses of those symbols in the currently running kernel are substituted into  the module s code only then is the module passed to the kernel for loading if  the system utility cannot resolve any references in the module by looking them  up in the kernel s symbol table then the module is rejected  the loading of the module is performed in two stages first the module\\xad loader utility asks the kernel to reserve a continuous area of virtual kernel  memory for the module the kernel returns the address of the memory  allocated and the loader utility can use this address to relocate the module s  machine code to the correct loading address a second system call then passes  the module plus any symbol table that the new module wants to export to the  kernel the module itself is now copied verbatim into the previously allocated  space and the kernel s symbol table is updated with the new symbols for  possible use by other modules not yet loaded  the final module management component is the module requestor the  kernel defines a communication interface to which a module management  program can connect with this connection established the kernel will inform  the management process whenever a process requests a device driver file  system or network service that is not currently loaded and will give the  manager the opportunity to load that service the original service request will  complete once the module is loaded the manager process regularly queries  the kernel to see whether a dynamically loaded module is still in use and  unloads that module when it is no longer actively needed   driver registration  once a module is loaded it remains no more than an isolated region of memory  until it lets the rest of the kernel know what new functionality it provides  the kernel maintains dynamic tables of all known drivers and provides a  set of routines to allow drivers to be added to or removed from these tables  at any time the kernel makes sure that it calls a module s startup routine  when that module is loaded and calls the module s cleanup routine before that  module is unloaded these routines are responsible for registering the module s  functionality  a module may register many types of drivers and may register more than  one driver if it wishes for example a device driver might want to register two  separate mechanisms for accessing the device registration tables include the  following items    device drivers these drivers include character devices such as printers  terminals and mice block devices including all disk drives and network  interface devices  file systems the file system may be anything that implements linux s  virtual file system calling routines it might implement a format for storing  files on a disk but it might equally well be a network file system such as  nfs or a virtual file system whose contents are generated on demand such  as linux s proc file system  network protocols a module may implement an entire networking  protocot such as ipx or simply a new set of packet filtering rules for a  network firewall  binary format this format specifies a way of recognizing and loading a  new type of executable file  in addition a module can register a new set of entries in the sysctl and proc  tables to allow that module to be configured dynamically section    conflict resolution  commercial unix implementations are usually sold to run on a vendor s  own hardware one advantage of a single supplier solution is that the  software vendor has a good idea about what hardware configurations are  possible pc hardware however comes in a vast number of configurations  with large numbers of possible drivers for devices such as network cards  scsi controllers and video display adapters the problem of managing the  hardware configuration becomes more severe when modular device drivers  are supported since the currently active set of devices becomes dynamically  variable  linux provides a central conflict resolution mechanism to help arbitrate  access to certain hardware resources its aims are as follows  to prevent modules from clashing over access to hardware resources  to prevent aui oprobes device driver probes that auto detect device  configuration from interfering with existing device drivers  to resolve conflicts among multiple drivers trying to access the same  hardware for example as when both the parallel printer driver and the  parallel line ip pup network driver try to talk to the parallel printer port  to these ends the kernel maintains lists of allocated hardware resources  the pc has a limited number of possible i ports addresses in its hardware  i address space interrupt lines and dma channels when any device driver  wants to access such a resource it is expected to reserve the resource with  the kernel database first this requirement incidentally allows the system  administrator to determine exactly which resources have been allocated by  which driver at any given point  a module is expected to use this mechanism to reserve in advance any  hardware resources that it expects to use if the reservation is rejected because  the resource is not present or is already in use then it is up to the module   chapter   to decide how to proceed it may fail its initialization and request that it be  unloaded if it cannot continue or it may carry on using alternative hardware  resources  a process is the basic context within which all user requested activity is  serviced within the operating system to be compatible with other unix  systems linux must use a process model similar to those of other versions  of unix linux operates differently from unix in a few key places however in  this section we review the traditional unix process model section a and  introduce linux s own threading model   the fork and exec process model  the basic principle of unix process management is to separate two operations  the creation of a process and the rum ing of a new program a new process  is created by the fork system call and a new program is run after a call to  exec these are two distinctly separate functions a new process may be  created with fork without a new program being run the new subprocess  simply continues to execute exactly the same program that the first parent  process was running equally running a new program does not require that  a new process be created first any process may call exec at any time the  currently rumung program is immediately terminated and the new program  starts executing in the context of the existing process  this model has the advantage of great simplicity it is not necessary to  specify every detail of the environment of a new program in the system call that  runs that program the new program simply runs in its existing environment  if a parent process wishes to modify the environment in which a new program  is to be run it can fork and then still running the original program in a child  process make any system calls it requires to modify that child process before  finally executing the new program  under unix then a process encompasses all the information that the  operating system must maintain to track the context of a single execution of a  single program under linux we can break down this context into a number of  specific sections broadly process properties fall into three groups the process  identity environment and context   process identity  a process identity consists mainly of the following items  process id pid each process has a lmique identifier the pid is used to  specify the process to the operating system when an application makes a  system call to signal modify or wait for the process additional identifiers  associate the process with a process group typically a tree of processes  forked by a single user command and login session  credentials each process must have an associated user id and one or more  group ids user groups are discussed in section  that determine the  rights of a process to access system resources and files    personality process personalities are not traditionally found on unix  systems but under linux each process has an associated personality  identifier that can slightly modify the semantics of certain system calls  personalities are primarily used by emulation libraries to request that  system calls be compatible with certain varieties of unix  most of these identifiers are under the limited control of the process  itself the process group and session identifiers can be changed if the process  wants to start a new group or session its credentials can be changed subject  to appropriate security checks process environment  a process s environment is inherited from its parent and is composed of two  null terminated vectors the argument vector and the enviromnent vector the  argument vector simply lists the command line arguments used to invoke the  running program it conventionally starts with the name of the program itself  the environment vector is a list of name value pairs that associates named  environment variables with arbitrary textual values the environment is not  held in kernel memory but is stored in the process s own user mode address  space as the first datum at the top of the process s stack  the argument and environment vectors are not altered when a new process  is created the new child process will inherit the environment that its parent  possesses however a completely new environment is set up when a new  program is invoked on calling exec a process must supply the environment  for the new program the kernel passes these enviromnent variables to the next  program replacing the process s current environment the kernel otherwise  leaves the environment and command line vectors alone their interpretation  is left entirely to the user mode libraries and applications  the passing of environment variables from one process to the next and the  inheriting of these variables by the children of a process provide flexible ways  to pass information to components of the user mode system software various  important environment variables have conventional meanings to related parts  of the system software for example the term variable is set up to name the  type of terminal com ected to a user s login session many programs use this  variable to determine how to perform operations on the user s display such as  moving the cursor and scrolling a region of text programs with multilingual  support use the lang variable to determine in which language to display  system messages for programs that include multilingual support  the environment variable mechanism custom tailors the operating system  on a per process basis rather than for the system as a whole users can choose  their own languages or select their own editors independently of one another   process context  the process identity and environment properties are usually set up when a  process is created and not changed until that process exits a process may  choose to change some aspects of its identity if it needs to do so or it may  alter its environment in contrast process context is the state of the running   chapter  program at any one time it changes constantly process context includes the  following parts  scheduling context the most important part of the process context is its  scheduling context the information that the scheduler needs to suspend  and restart the process this information includes saved copies of all the  process s registers floating point registers are stored separately and are  restored only when needed so that processes that do not use floating point  arithmetic do not incur the overhead of saving that state the scheduling  context also includes information about scheduling priority and about any  outstanding signals waiting to be delivered to the process a key part of the  scheduling context is the process s kernel stack a separate area of kernel  memory reserved for use exclusively by kernel mode code both system  calls and interrupts that occur while the process is executing will use this  stack  accounting the kernel maintains accounting information about the  resources currently being consumed by each process and the total resources  consumed by the process in its entire lifetime so far  file table the file table is an array of pointers to kernel file structures  when making file i o system calls processes refer to files by their index  into this table  file system context whereas the file table lists the existing open files the  file system context applies to requests to open new files the current root  and default directories to be used for new file searches are stored here  signal handler table unix systems can deliver asynchronous signals to  a process in response to various external events the signal handler table  defines the routine in the process s address space to be called when a  specific signal arrives  virtual memory context the virtual memory context describes the full  contents of a process s private address space we discuss it in section   processes and threads  linux provides the fork system call with the traditional functionality of  duplicating a process linux also provides the ability to create threads using the  clone system call however linux does not distinguish between processes  and threads in fact linux generally uses the term task rather than process or  thread when referring to a flow of control within a program when clone  is invoked it is passed a set of flags that determine how much sharing is to  take place between the parent and child tasks some of these flags are  thus if clone is passed the flags clone fs clone vm clone sighand  and clone files the parent and child tasks will share the same file system  information such as the current working directory the same memory space  the same signal handlers and the same set of open files using clone in this  fashion is equivalent to creating a thread in other systems since the parent task  shares most of its resources with its child task however if none of these flags is  set when clone is invoked no sharing takes place resulting in functionality  similar to the fork system call  the lack of distinction between processes and threads is possible because  linux does not hold a process s entire context within the main process data  structure rather it holds the context within independent subcontexts thus  a process s file system context file descriptor table signal handler table and  virtual memory context are held in separate data structures the process data  structure simply contains pointers to these other structures so any number of  processes can easily share a subcontext by pointing to the same subcontext  the arguments to the clone system call tell it which subcontexts to copy  and which to share when it creates a new process the new process always is  given a new identity and a new scheduling context according to the arguments  passed however it may either create new subcontext data struchres initialized  to be copies of the parent s or set up the new process to use the same subcontext  data structures being used by the parent the fork system call is nothing  more than a special case of clone that copies all subcontexts sharing none  scheduling is the job of allocating cpu time to different tasks within an  operating system normally we think of scheduling as being the running and  interrupting of processes but another aspect of scheduling is also important  to linux the running of the various kernel tasks kernel tasks encompass both  tasks that are requested by a running process and tasks that execute internally  on behalf of a device driver   process scheduling  linux has two separate process scheduling algorithms one is a time sharing  algorithm for fair preemptive scheduling among multiple processes the other  is designed for real time tasks where absolute priorities are more important  than fairness  the scheduling algorithm used for routine time sharing tasks received  a major overhaul with version of the kernel earlier versions of the linux  kernel ran a variation of the traditional unix scheduling algorithm which does  not provide adequate support for smp systems and does not scale well as the  number of tasks on the system grows the overhaul of the linux scheduler with  version of the kernel provides a scheduling algorithm that runs in constant  time known as regardless of the number of tasks on the system the  new scheduler also provides increased support for smp including processor  affin ity and load balancing as well as maintaining fairness and support for  interactive tasks  figure the relationship between priorities and time slice length  the linux scheduler is a preemptive priority based algorithm with two  separate priority ranges a real time range from to and a nice value ranging  from to these two ranges map into a global priority scheme whereby  numerically lower values indicate higher priorities  unlike schedulers for many other systems the linux scheduler assigns  higher priority tasks longer time quanta and lower priority tasks shorter time  quanta because of the unique nature of the scheduler this is appropriate for  lim ix as we shall soon see the relationship between priorities and time slice  length is shown in figure  a rum able task is considered eligible for execution on the cpu so long as  it has time remaining in its time slice when a task has exhausted its time slice  it is considered expired and is not eligible for execution again until all other  tasks have also exhausted their time quanta the kernel maintains a list of all  runnable tasks in a runqueue data structure because of its support for smp  each processor maintains its own runqueue and schedules itself independently  each runqueue contains two priority arrays active and expired the active  array contains all tasks with time remaining in their time slices and the expired  array contains all expired tasks each of these priority arrays includes a list of  tasks indexed according to priority figure  the scheduler chooses the  task with the highest priority from the active array for execution on the cpu  on multiprocessor machines this means that each processor is scheduling  the highest priority task from its own runqueue structure when all tasks  have exhausted their time slices that is the active array is empty the two  priority arrays are exchanged as the expired array becomes the active array  and vice versa  tasks are assigned dynamic priorities that are based on the nice value plus  or minus a value up to the value w ether a value is added to or subtracted  from a task s nice value depends on the interactivity of the task a task s  interactivity is determined by how long it has been sleeping while waiting  for i tasks that are more interactive typically have longer sleep times and  therefore are more likely to have adjustments closer to as the scheduler  favors such interactive tasks conversely tasks with shorter sleep times are  often cpu bound and thus will have their priorities lowered  a task s dynamic priority is recalculated when the task has exhausted its  time quantum and is to be moved to the expired array thus when the two  figure list of tasks indexed according to priority  arrays are exchanged all tasks in the new active array have been assigned new  priorities and corresponding time slices  linux s real time scheduling is simpler still linux implements the two real\\xad time scheduling classes required by posix lb first come first served fcfs  and round robin sections and  respectively in both cases each  process has a priority irt addition to its scheduling class processes with  different priorities can compete with one another to some extent in time sharing  scheduling in real time scheduling however the scheduler always runs the  process with the highest priority among processes of equal priority it runs  the process that has been waiting longest the only difference between fcfs  and round robin scheduling is that fcfs processes continue to nm until they  either exit or block whereas a round robill process will be preempted after a  while and will be moved to the end of the scheduling queue so round robin  processes of equal priority will automatically time share among themselves  unlike routine time sharing tasks real time tasks are assigned static priorities  linux s real time scheduling is soft rather than hard real time the  scheduler offers strict guarantees about the relative priorities of real time  processes but the kernel does not offer any guarantees about how quickly  a reahim e process will be scheduled once that process becomes runnable   kernel synchronization  the way the kernel schedules its own operations is fundamentally different  from the way it schedules processes a request for kernel mode execution  can occur in two ways a running program may request an operating system  service either explicitly via a system call or implicitly for example when a  page fault occurs alternatively a device controller may deliver a hardware  interrupt that causes the cpu to start executing a kernel defined handler for  that interrupt  the problem posed to the kernel is that all these tasks may try to access the  sanl e internal data structures if one kernel task is in the middle of accessing  some data structure when an interrupt service routine executes then that  service routine cannot access or modify the same data without risking data  corruption this fact relates to the idea of critical sections portions of code  that access shared data and that must not be allowed to execute concurrently  as a result kernel synchronization involves much more than just process  scheduling a framework is required that allows kernel tasks to run without  violating the integrity of shared data   chapter  prior to version linux was a nonpreernptive kernet meaning that a  process running in kernel mode could not be preempted even if a higher\\xad priority process became available to run with version the linux kernel  became fully preemptive so a task can now be preempted when it is running  in the kernel  the limix kernel provides spinlocks and semaphores as well as reader\\xad writer versions of these two locks for locking in the kernel on smp machines  the fundamental locking mechanism is a spinlock the kernel is designed so that  the spinlock is held only for short durations on single processor machines  spinlocks are inappropriate for use and are replaced by enabling and disabling  kernel preemption that is on single processor machines rather than holding a  spinlock the task disables kernel preemption when the task would otherwise  release the spinlock it enables kernel preemption this pattern is summarized  below  linux uses an interesting approach to disable and enable kernel preemp\\xad tion it provides two simple system calls preempldisable and pre\\xad emplenable for disabling and enabling kernel preemption however in  addition the kernel is not preemptible if a kernel mode task is holding a lock  to enforce this rule each task in the system has a thread info structure that  includes the field preempt count which is a counter indicating the number of  locks being held by the task the counter is incremented when a lock is acquired  and decremented when a lock is released if the value of preemplcount for the  task currently running is greater than zero it is not safe to preempt the kernet  as this task currently holds a lock if the count is zero the kernel can safely be  interrupted assuming there are no outstanding calls to preempt disable   spinlocks along with enabling and disabling of kernel preemption are  used in the kernel only when the lock is held for short durations when a lock  must be held for longer periods semaphores are used  the second protection technique used by linux applies to critical sections  that occur in interrupt service routines the basic tool is the processor s  interrupt control hardware by disabling interrupts or using spinlocks during  a critical section the kernel guarantees that it can proceed without the risk of  concurrent access to shared data structures  however there is a penalty for disabling interrupts on most hardware  architectures interrupt enable and disable instructions are expensive further\\xad more as long as interrupts remain disabled all i is suspended and any  device waiting for servicing will have to wait until interrupts are reenabled so  performance degrades the linux kernel uses a synchronization architecture  that allows long critical sections to run for their entire duration without having  interrupts disabled this ability is especially useful in the networking code an  interrupt in a network device driver can signal the arrival of an entire network  packet which may result in a great deal of code being executed to disassemble  route and forward that packet within the interrupt service routine    kernel system service routines preemptible  user mode programs preemptible  figure interrupt protection levels  linux implements this architecture by separating interrupt service routines  into two sections the top half and the bottom half the is a normal  interrupt service routine that runs with recursive interrupts disabled interrupts  of a higher priority may interrupt the routine but interrupts of the same  or lower priority are disabled the of a service routine is run  with all interrupts enabled by a miniature scheduler that ensures that bottom  halves never interrupt themselves the bottom half scheduler is invoked  automatically whenever an interrupt service routine exits  this separation means that the kernel can complete any complex processing  that has to be done in response to an interrupt without worrying about being  interrupted itself if another interrupt occurs while a bottom half is executing  then that interrupt can request that the same bottom half execute but the  execution will be deferred until the one currently running completes each  execution of the bottom half can be interrupted by a top half but can never be  interrupted by a similar bottom half  the top half bottom half architecture is completed by a mechanism for  disabling selected bottom halves while executing normal foreground kernel  code the kernel can code critical sections easily using this system interrupt  handlers can code their critical sections as bottom halves and when the  foreground kernel wants to enter a critical section it can disable any relevant  bottom halves to prevent any other critical sections from interrupting it at  tle end of the critical section the kernel can reenable the bottom halves and  run any bottom half tasks that have been queued by top half interrupt service  routines during the critical section  figure summarizes the various levels of interrupt protection within  the kernel each level may be interrupted by code running at a higher level  but will never be interrupted by code running at the same or a lower level  except for user mode code user processes can always be preempted by another  process when a time sharing scheduling interrupt occurs   symmetric multiprocessing  the linux kernel was the first stable linux kernel to support  hardware allowing separate processes to execute in  parallel on separate processors originally the implementation of smp imposed  the restriction that only one processor at a time could be executing kernel mode  code   chapter   in version of the kernel a single kernel spinlock sometimes termed  bkl for big kernel lock was created to allow multiple processes running  on different processors to be active in the kernel concurrently however the  bkl provided a very coarse level of locking granularity later releases of the  kernel made the smp implementation more scalable by splitting this single  kernel spinlock into multiple locks each of which protects only a small subset  of the kernel s data structures such spinlocks are described in section   the kernel provided additional smp enhancements including processor  affinity and load balancing algorithms  memory management under linux has two components the first deals with  allocating and freeing physical memory pages groups of pages and small  blocks of memory the second handles virtual memory which is memory  mapped into the address space of running processes in this section we  describe these two components and then examine the mechanisms by which  the loadable components of a new program are brought il lto a process s virtual  memory in response to an exec system call   management of physical memory  due to specific hardware characteristics linux separates physical memory into  three different zones or regions  zone dma  zone normal  zone highmem  these zones are architecture specific for example on the intel x archi\\xad tecture certain isa industry standard architecture devices can only access  the lower mb of physical memory using dma on these systems the  first mb of physical memory comprise zonldma zone normal identifies  physical memory that is mapped to the cpu s address space this zone is  used for most routine memory requests for architectures that do not limit  what dma can access zonldma is not present and zone normal is used  finally zone highmem for high memory refers to physical memory that is  not mapped into the kernel address space for example on the bit intel  architecture where provides a gb address space the kernel is mapped  into the first mb of the address space the remaining memory is referred  to as high memory and is allocated from zone highmem the relationship of  zones and physical addresses on the intelx architecture is shown in figure   the kernel maintains a list of free pages for each zone when a request for  physical memory arrives the kernel satisfies the request using the appropriate  zone  the priinary physical memory manager in the lil lux kernel is the page  allocator each zone has its own allocator which is responsible for allocating  and freeing all physical pages for the zone and is capable of allocating ranges    figure relationship of zones and physical addresses on the lntelx  of physically contiguous pages on request the allocator uses a buddy system   section  to keep track of available physical pages in this scheme  adjacent units of allocatable memory are paired together hence its name each  allocatable memory region has an adjacent partner or buddy whenever two  allocated partner regions are freed up they are combined to form a larger  region a buddy heap that larger region also has a partner with which it can  combine to form a still larger free region conversely if a small memory request  cannot be satisfied by allocation of an existing small free region then a larger  free region will be subdivided into two partners to satisfy the request separate  linked lists are used to record the free memory regions of each allowable size  under linux the smallest size allocatable under this mechanism is a single  physical page figure shows an example of buddy heap allocation a kb  region is being allocated but the smallest available region is kb the region  is broken up recursively until a piece of the desired size is available  ultim ately all memory allocations in the linux kernel are ncade either  statically by drivers that reserve a contiguous area of memory during system  boot time or dynamically by the page allocator however kernel functions  do not have to use the basic allocator to reserve memory several specialized  memory management subsystems use the underlying page allocator to man\\xad age their own pools of memory the most important are the virtual memory  system described in section  the kmalloc variable length allocator  the slab allocator used for allocating memory for kernel data structures and  the page cache used for caching pages belonging to files  many components of the linux operating system need to allocate entire  pages on request but often smaller blocks of memory are required the kernel  kb kb  kb  kb  figure splitting of memory in the buddy system   chapter  provides an additional allocator for arbitrary sized requests where the size of  a request is not known in advance and may be only a few bytes analogous  to the c language s malloc function this kmalloc service allocates entire  pages on demand but then splits them into smaller pieces the kernel maintains  lists of pages in use by the kmalloc service allocating memory involves  determining the appropriate list and either taking the first free piece available  on the list or allocating a new page and splitting it up memory regions clain led  by the kmalloc system are allocated permanently until they are freed  explicitly the kmalloc system cannot reallocate or reclaim these regions  in response to memory shortages  another strategy adopted by linux for allocating kernel memory is known  as slab allocation a slab is used for allocating memory for kernel data  structures and is made up of one or more physically contiguous pages a  consists of one or more slabs there is a single cache for each unique kernel data  structure a cache for the data structure representing process descriptors a  cache for file objects a cache for semaphores and so forth each cache is  populated with that are instantiations of the kernel data structure  the cache represents for example the cache representing semaphores stores  instances of semaphore objects and the cache representing process descriptors  stores instances of process descriptor objects the relationship among slabs  caches and objects is shown in figure the figure shows two kernel  objects kb in size and three objects kb in size these objects are stored  in the respective caches for kb and kb objects  the slab allocation algorithm uses caches to store kernel objects when a  cache is created a number of objects are allocated to the cache the number of  objects in the cache depends on the size of the associated slab for example  a kb slab made up of three contiguous kb pages could store six kb  objects initially all the objects in the cache are marked as free when a new  object for a kernel data structure is needed the allocator can assign any free  kernel objects  object from the cache to satisfy the request the object assigned from the cache  is marked as used  let s consider a scenario in which the kernel requests memory from the  slab allocator for an object representing a process descriptor in linux systems  a process descriptor is of the type struct task struct which requires  approximately kb of memory when the linux kernel creates a new task  it requests the necessary memory for the struct task struct object from its  cache the cache will fulfill the request using a struct task struct object  that has already been allocated in a slab and is marked as free  in linux a slab may be in one of three possible states   full all objects in the slab are marked as used  empty all objects in the slab are marked as free  partial the slab consists of both used and free objects  the slab allocator first attempts to satisfy the request with a free object in a  partial slab if none exist a free object is assigned from an empty slab if no  empty slabs are available a new slab is allocated from contiguous physical  pages and assigned to a cache memory for the object is allocated from this  slab  two other main subsystems in linux do their own management of physical  pages the page cache and the virtual memory system these systems are closely  related to one another the page cache is the kernel s main cache for block  devices section  and memory mapped files and is the main mechanism  through which i to these devices is performed both the native linux disk\\xad based file systems and the nfs networked file system use the page cache  the page cache stores entire pages of file contents and is not limited to block  devices it can also cache networked data the virtual memory system manages  the contents of each process s virtual address space these two systems interact  closely with one another because reading a page of data into the page cache  requires mapping pages in the page cache using the virtual memory system in  the following section we look at the virtual memory system in greater detail   virtual memory  the limn virtual memory system is responsible for maintaining the address  space visible to each process it creates pages of virtual memory on demand  and manages loading those pages from disk and swapping them back out to  disk as required under linux the virtual memory manager maintains two  separate views of a process s address space as a set of separate regions and as  a set of pages  the first view of an address space is the logical view describing instructions  that the virtual memory system has received concerning the layout of the  address space in this view the address space consists of a set of non\\xad overlapping regions each region representing a continuous page aligned  subset of the address space each region is described internally by a single  vm area struct structure that defines the properties of the region including  the process s read write and execute permissions in the region as well as  information about any files associated with the region the regions for each   chapter  address space are linked into a balanced binary tree to allow fast lookllp of the  region corresponding to any virtual address  the kernel also n laintains a second physical view of each address space  this view is stored in the hardware page tables for the process the page\\xad table entries identify the exact current location of each page of virtual mernory  whether it is on disk or in physical memory the physical view is managed by a  set of routines which are invoked from the kernel s software interrupt handlers  whenever a process tries to access a page that is not currently present in the page  tables each vm area struct in the address space description contains a field  that points to a table of functions that implement the key page management  functions for any given virtual memory region all requests to read or write  an unavailable page are eventually dispatched to the appropriate handler  in the function table for the vm area struct so that the central memory\\xad management routines do not have to know the details of managing each  possible type of memory region   virtual memory regions  linux implements several types of virtual memory regions one property  that characterizes virtual memory is the backing store for the region which  describes where the pages for the region come from most memory regions  are backed either by a file or by nothing a region backed by nothing is the  simplest type of virtual memory region such a region represents demand zero  memory when a process tries to read a page in such a region it is simply given  back a page of memory filled with zeros  a region backed by a file acts as a viewport onto a section of that file  whenever the process tries to access a page within that region the page table  is filled with the address of a page within the kernel s page cache corresponding  to the appropriate offset in the file the same page of physical memory is used  by both the page cache and the process s page tables so any changes made to  the file by the file system are immediately visible to any processes that have  mapped that file into their address space any number of processes can map  the same region of the same file and they will all end up using the same page  of physical memory for the purpose  a virtual memory region is also defined by its reaction to writes the  mapping of a region into the process s address space can be either private or  shared if a process writes to a privately mapped region then the pager detects  that a copy on write is necessary to keep the changes local to the process in  contrast writes to a shared region result in updating of the object mapped into  that region so that the change will be visible immediately to any other process  that is mapping that object   lifetime of a virtual address space  the kernel will create a new virtual address space in two situations when a  process runs a new program with the exec system call and when a new  process is created by the fork system call the first case is easy when a  new program is executed the process is given a new completely empty virtual  address space it is up to the routines for loading the program to populate the  address space with virtual memory regions    the second case creating a new process with fork involves creating  a concplete copy of the existing process s virtual address space the kernel  copies the parent process s vm area struct descriptors then creates a new set  of page tables for the child the parent s page tables are copied directly into  the child s and the reference count of each page covered is incremented thus  after the fork the parent and child share the same physical pages of memory  in their address spaces  a special case occurs when the copying operation reaches a virtual memory  region that is mapped privately any pages to which the parent process has  written within such a region are private and subsequent changes to these pages  by either the parent or the child must not update the page in the other process s  address space when the page table entries for such regions are copied they  are set to be read only and are marked for copy on write as long as neither  process modifies these pages the two processes share the same page of physical  memory however if either process tries to modify a copy on write page the  reference count on the page is checked if the page is still shared then the  process copies the page s contents to a brand new page of physical memory  and uses its copy instead this mechanism ensures that private data pages  are shared between processes whenever possible copies are made only when  absolutely necessary   swapping and paging  an important task for a virtual memory system is to relocate pages of memory  from physical memory out to disk when that inemory is needed early unix  systems performed this relocation by swapping out the contents of entire  processes at once but modern versions of unix rely more on paging the  movement of individual pages of virtual memory between physical memory  and disk linux does not implement whole process swapping it uses the newer  paging mechanism exclusively  the paging system can be divided into two sections first the  decides which to write out to disk and when to write them  second the carries out the transfer and pages data back  into physical memory when they are needed again  linux s pageuut policy uses a modified version of the standard clock or  second chance algorithm described in section  under linux a multiple\\xad pass clock is used and every page has an age that is adjusted on each pass of  the clock the age is more precisely a measure of the page s youthfulness or  how much activity the page has seen recently frequently accessed pages will  attain a higher age value but the age of infrequently accessed pages will drop  toward zero with each pass this age valuing allows the pager to select pages  to page out based on a least frequently used lfu policy  the paging mechanism supports paging both to dedicated swap devices  and partitions and to normal files although swapping to a file is significantly  slower due to the extra overhead incurred by the file system blocks are  allocated from the swap devices according to a bitmap of used blocks which  is maintained in physical memory at all times the allocator uses a next fit  algorithm to try to write out pages to continuous runs of disk blocks for  improved performance the allocator records the fact that a page has been  paged out to disk by using a feature of the page tables on modern processors   chapter  the page table entry s page not present bit is set allowing the rest of the page\\xad table entry to be filled with an index identifying where the page has been  written   kernel virtual memory  linux reserves for its own internal use a constant architecture dependent  region of the virtual address space of every process the page table entries  that map to these kernel pages are marked as protected so that the pages are  not visible or modifiable when the processor is running in user mode this  kernel virtual memory area contains two regions the first is a static area that  contains page table references to every available physical page of memory  in the system so that a simple translation from physical to virtual addresses  occurs when kernel code is run the core of the kernel along with all pages  allocated by the normal page allocator resides in this region  the remainder of the kernel s reserved section of address space is not  reserved for any specific purpose page table entries in this address range  can be modified by the kernel to point to any other areas of memory the  kernel provides a pair of facilities that allow processes to use this virtual  memory the vmalloc function allocates an arbitrary number of physical  pages of memory that may not be physically contiguous into a single region of  virtually contiguous kernel memory the vremap function maps a sequence  of virtual addresses to point to an area of memory used by a device driver for  memory mapped i   execution and loading of user programs  the linux kernel s execution of user programs is triggered by a call to  the exec system call this exec call commands the kernel to run a  new program within the current process completely overwriting the current  execution context with the initial context of the new program the first job of  this system service is to verify that the calling process has permission rights to  the file being executed once that matter has been checked the kernel invokes  a loader routine to start running the program the loader does not necessarily  load the contents of the program file into physical memory but it does at least  set up the mapping of the program into virtual memory  there is no single routine in linux for loadil g a new program instead  linux maintains a table of possible loader functions and it gives each such  function the opportunity to try loading the given file when an exec system  call is made the initial reason for this loader table was that between the  releases of the and kernels the standard format for linux s binary files  was changed older linux kernels understood the a out format for binary  files a relatively simple format common on older unix systems newer  linux systems use the more modern elf format now supported by most  current unix implementations elf has a number of advantages over a out  including flexibility and extensibility new sections can be added to an elf  binary for example to add extra debugging information without causing  the loader routines to become confused by allowing registration of multiple  loader routines linux can easily support the elf and a out binary formats in  a single rmming system    in sections  and  we concentrate exclusively on the loading  and running of elf format binaries the procedure for loading a out binaries  is simpler but is similar in operation   mapping of programs into memory  under linux the binary loader does not load a binary file into physical memory  rather the pages of the binary file are mapped into regions of virtual memory  only when the program tries to access a given page will a page fault result in  the loading of that page into physical memory using demand paging  it is the responsibility of the kernel s binary loader to set up the initial  memory mapping an elf format binary file consists of a header followed by  several page aligned sections the elf loader works by reading the header and  mapping the sections of the file into separate regions of virtual memory  figure shows the typical layout of memory regions set up by the elf  loader in a reserved region at one end of the address space sits the kernet in  its own privileged region of virtual memory inaccessible to normal user mode  programs the rest of virtual memory is available to applications which can use  the kernel s memory mapping functions to create regions that map a portion  of a file or that are available for application data  the loader s job is to set up the initial memory mapping to allow the  execution of the program to start the regions that need to be initialized il clude  the stack and the program s text and data regions  the stack is created at the top of the user mode virtual memory it  grows downward toward lower numbered addresses it includes copies of the  chapter   data are mapped into memory as a write protected region writable initialized  data are mapped next then any uninitialized data are mapped in as a private  demand zero region  directly beyond these fixed sized regions is a variable sized region that  programs can expand as needed to hold data allocated at run time each  process has a pointer brk that points to the current extent of this data region  and processes can extend or contract their brk region with a single system call   sbrko  once these mappings have been set up the loader initializes the process s  program counter register with the starting point recorded in the elf header  and the process can be scheduled   static and dynamic linking  once the program has been loaded and has started running all the necessary  contents of the binary file have been loaded into the process s virtual address  space however most programs also need to run functions from the system  libraries and these library functions must also be loaded in the simplest  case the necessary library functions are embedded directly in the program s  executable binary file such a program is statically linked to its libraries and  statically linked executables can commence running as soon as they are loaded  the main disadvantage of static linking is that every program generated  must contain copies of exactly the same common system library functions it is  much more efficient in terms of both physical memory and disk space usage  to load the system libraries into ltl emory only once dynamic linking allows  this single loading to happen  linux implements dynamic linking in user mode through a special linker  library every dynamically linked program contains a small statically linked  function that is called when the program starts this static function just maps  the link library into memory and runs the code that the function contains the  link library determines the dynamic libraries required by the program and the  names of the variables and functions needed from those libraries by reading the  information contained in sections of the elf binary it then maps the libraries  into the middle of virtual memory and resolves the references to the symbols  contained in those libraries it does not matter exactly where in memory these  shared libraries are mapped they are compiled into position independent  code pic which can run at any address in memory  linux retains unix s standard file system model in unix a file does not have  to be an object stored on disk or fetched over a network from a remote file  server rather unix files can be anything capable of handling the input or  output of a stream of data device drivers can appear as files and interprocess\\xad communication channels or network connections also look like files to the  user  the linux kernel handles all these types of files by hiding the implemen\\xad tation details of any single file type behind a layer of software the virtual file    systen vfs here we first cover the virtual file system and then discuss the  standard linux file system extfs   the virtual file system  the linux vfs is designed around object oriented principles it has two  components a set of definitions that specify what file system objects are  allowed to look like and a layer o£ software to manipulate the objects the  vfs defines four main object types  an inode object represents an individual file  a file object represents an open file  a superblock object represents an entire file system  a dentry object represents an il ldividual directory entry  for each of these four object types the vfs defines a set of operations  every object of one of these types contains a pointer to a function table the  function table lists the addresses of the actual functions that implement the  defined operations for that object for example an abbreviated api for some of  the file object s operations includes  int open    open a file  ssize t read   read from a file  ssize t write   write to a file  int mmap    memory map a file  the complete definition of the file object is specified in the struct  file operations which is located in the file usr include linux fs h  an irnplementation of the file object for a specific file type is required to  implement each function specified il l the definition of the file object  the vfs software layer can perform an operation on one of the file system  objects by calling the appropriate function from the object s function table  without havil g to know in advance exactly what kind of object it is dealing  with the vfs does not know or care whether an inode represents a networked  file a disk file a network socket or a directory file the appropriate function  for that file s read operation will always be at the same place in its function  table and the vfs software layer will call that function without caring how the  data are actually read  the inode and file objects are the mechanisms used to access files an inode  object is a data structure containing pointers to the disk blocks that contain the  actual file contents and a file object represents a point of access to the data in an  open file a process cannot access an inode s contents without first obtaining a  file object pointing to the inode the file object keeps track of where in the file  the process is currently reading or writing to keep track of sequential file l it  also remembers whether the process asked for write permissions when the file  was opened and tracks the process s activity if necessary to perform adaptive   chapter  read ahead fetching file data into memory before the process requests the data  to improve performance  file objects typically belong to a single process but inode objects do not  even when a file is no longer being used by any processes its inode object  may still be cached by the vfs to improve performance if the file is used again  in the near future all cached file data are linked onto a list in the file s inode  object the inode also maintains standard information about each file such as  the owner size and time most recently modified  directory files are dealt with slightly differently from other files the unix  programming interface defines a number of operations on directories such as  creating deleting and renaming a file in a directory the system calls for these  directory operations do not require that the user open the files concerned  unlike the case for reading or writing data the vfs therefore defines these  directory operations in the inode object rather than in the file object  the superblock object represents a connected set of files that form a  self contained file system the operating system kernel maintains a single  superblock object for each disk device mounted as a file system and for each  networked file system currently connected the main responsibility of the  superblock object is to provide access to inodes the vfs identifies every  inode by a unique file system inode number pair and it fil ds the inode  corresponding to a particular inode number by asking the superblock object to  return the inode with that number  finally a dentry object represents a directory entry that may include the  name of a directory in the path name of a file such as usr or the actual file   such as stdio h for example the file usr i include stdio h contains the  directory entries   usr  include and stdio h each one of these  values is represented by a separate dentry object  as an example of how dentry objects are used consider the situ\\xad ation in which a process wishes to open the file with the pathname   usr i include stdio h using an editor because linux treats directory names  as files translating this path requires first obtaining the inode for the root\\xad  the operating system must then read through this file to obtain the inode  for the file include it must continue this process until it obtains the inode for  the file stdio h because path name translation can be a time consuming task  linuxmaintains a cache of dentry objects which is consulted during path name  translation obtaining the inode from the dentry cache is considerably faster  than having to read the on disk file   the linux extfs file system  the standard on disk file system used by linux is called extfs for historical  reasons linux was originally programmed with a minix compatible file  system to ease exchanging data with the minix development system but  that file system was severely restricted by character file name limits and a  maximum file system size of mb the minix file system was superseded by  a new file system which was christened the extended file system extfs a  later redesign of this file system to improve performance and scalability and  to add a few missing features led to the second extended file system extfs  linuxs extfs has much in common with the bsd fast file system ffs   section a  it uses a similar mechanism for locating the data blocks    belonging to a specific file storing data block pointers in indirect blocks  throughout the file system with up to three levels of indirection as in ffs  directory files are stored on disk just like normal files although their contents  are interpreted differently each block in a directory file consists of a linked list  of entries each entry contains the length of the entry the name of a file and  the inode number of the inode to which that entry refers  the main differences between extfs and ffs lie in their disk allocation  policies in ffs the disk is allocated to files in blocks of kb these blocks are  subdivided into fragments of kb for storage of small files or partially filled  blocks at the ends of files in contrast extfs does not use fragments at all but  performs all its allocations in smaller units the default block size on extfs is   kb although kb and kb blocks are also supported  to maintain high performance the operating system must try to perform  i operations in large chunks whenever possible by clustering physically  adjacent l requests clustering reduces the per request overhead incurred  by device drivers disks and disk controller hardware a kb i request size  is too small to maintain good performance so extfs uses allocation policies  designed to place logically adjacent blocks of a file into physically adjacent  blocks on disk so that it can submit an i request fm several disk blocks as a  single operation  the extfs allocation policy comes in two parts as in ffs an extfs file  system is partitioned into multiple block groups ffs uses the similar concept  of cylinder groups where each group corresponds to a single cylinder of a  physical disk however modern disk drive technology packs sectors onto the  disk at different densities and thus with different cylinder sizes depending  on how far the disk head is from the center of the disk therefore fixed sized  cylinder groups do not necessarily correspond to the disk s geometry  when allocating a file extfs must first select the block group for that file  for data blocks it attempts to allocate the file to the block group to which the  file s inode has been allocated for inode allocations it selects the block group  in which the file s parent directory resides for nondirectory files directory  files are not kept together but rather are dispersed throughout the available  block groups these policies are designed not only to keep related information  within the same block group but also to spread out the disk load among the  disk s block groups to reduce the fragmentation of any one area of the disk  within a block group extfs tries to keep allocations physically contiguous  if possible reducing fragmentation if it can it maintains a bitmap of all free  blocks in a block group when allocating the first blocks for a new file it  starts searching for a free block from the beginning of the block group when  extending a file it continues the search from the block most recently allocated  to the file the search is performed in two stages first extfs searches for an  entire free byte in the bitmap if it fails to find one it looks for any free bit  the search for free bytes aims to allocate disk space in chunks of at least eight  blocks where possible  once a free block has been identified the search is extended backward until  an allocated block is encountered when a free byte is found in the bitmap this  backward extension prevents extfs from leaving a hole between the most  recently allocated block in the previous nonzero byte and the zero byte found  once the next block to be allocated has been found by either bit or byte search  extfs extends the allocation forward for up to eight blocks and preallocates  these extra blocks to the file this preallocation helps to reduce fragmentation  during in terleaved writes to separate files and also reduces the cpu cost of  disk allocation by allocating multiple blocks simultaneously the preallocated  blocks are returned to the free space bitmap when the file is closed  figure illustrates the allocation policies each row represents a  sequence of set and unset bits in an allocation bitmap indicating used and  free blocks on disk in the first case if we can find any free blocks sufficiently  near the start of the search then we allocate them no matter how fragmented  they may be the fragmentation is partially compensated for by the fact that  the blocks are close together and can probably all be read without any disk  seeks and allocating them all to one file is better in the long run than allocating  isolated blocks to separate files once large free areas become scarce on disk in  the second case we have not immediately found a free block close by so we  search forward for an entire free byte in the bitmap if we allocated that byte  as a whole we would end up creating a fragmented area of free space between  it and the allocation preceding it so before allocating we back up to make this  allocation flush with the allocation preceding it and then we allocate forward  to satisfy the default allocation of eight blocks   journaling  one popular feature in a file system is journaling whereby modifications  to the file system are sequentially written to a journal a set of operations  that performs a specific task is a transaction once a transaction is written to  the journat it is considered to be committed and the system call modifying  the file system write can return to the user process allowing it to  continue execution meanwhile the journal entries relating to the transaction  are replayed across the actual file system structures as the changes are made a    pointer is updated to indicate which actions have completed and which are still  incomplete when an entire committed transaction is concpleted it is removed  from the journal the journal which is actually a circular buffer may be in a  separate section of the file system or it may even be on a separate disk spindle  it is more efficient but more complex to have it under separate read write  heads thereby decreasing head contention and seek times  if the system crashes some transactions may remain in the journal those  transactions were never completed to the file system even though they were  committed by the operating system so they must be completed once the system  recovers the transactions can be executed from the pointer until the work is  complete and the file system structures remain consistent the only problem  occurs when a transaction has been aborted that is it was not committed  before the system crashed any changes from those transactions that were  applied to the file system must be undone again preserving the consistency of  the file system this recovery is all that is needed after a crash eliminating all  problems with consistency checking  journaling file systems are also typically faster than non journaling sys\\xad tems as updates proceed much faster when they are applied to the in memory  journal rather than directly to the on disk data structures the reason for this  improvement is found in the performance advantage of sequential i over  random i costly synchronous random writes to the file system are turned  into much less costly synchronous sequential writes to the file system s journal  those changes in turn are replayed asynchronously via random writes to the  appropriate structures the overall result is a significant gain in performance  of file system metadata oriented operations such as file creation and deletion  journaling is not provided in extfs it is provided however in another  common file system available for linux systems ext which is based on extfs   the unux process file system  the flexibility of the linux vfs enables us to implement a file system that does  not store data persistently at all but rather provides an interface to some other  functionality the linux process file system known as the proc file system  is an example of a file system whose contents are not actually stored anywhere  but are computed on demand according to user file i requests  a proc file system is not unique to linux svr unix introduced a proc  file system as an efficient interface to the kernel s process debugging support  each subdirectory of the file system corresponded not to a directory on any  disk but rather to an active process on the current system a listing of the file  system reveals one directory per process with the directory name being the  asch decimal representation of the process s unique process identifier pid  linux implements such a proc file system but extends it greatly by  adding a number of extra directories and text files under the file system s root  directory these new entries correspond to various statistics about the kernel  and the associated loaded drivers the proc file system provides a way for  programs to access this information as plain text files the standard unix user  environment provides powerful tools to process such files for example in  the past the traditional unix ps command for listing the states of all running  processes has been implemented as a privileged process that reads the process  state directly from the kernel s virtual memory under limx this command   chapter   is implemented as an entirely unprivileged program that simply parses and  formats the information from proc  the proc file system must implement two things a directory structu re  and the file contents within because a unix file system is defined as a set of file  and directory inodes identified by their inode numbers the proc file system  nmst define a unique and persistent inode number for each directory and the  associated files once such a mapping exists the file system can use this inode  number to identify just what operation is required when a user tries to read  from a particular file inode or to perform a lookup in a particular directory  inode when data are read from one of these files the proc file system will  collect the appropriate information format it into textual form and place it  into the requesting process s read buffer  the mapping from inode number to information type splits the inode  number into two fields in linux a pid is bits wide but an inode number is   bits the top bits of the inode number are interpreted as a pid and the  remaining bits define what type of information is being requested about that  process  a pid of zero is not valid so a zero pid field in the inode number is  taken to mean that this inode contains global rather than process specific\\xad information separate global files exist iil proc to report information such as  the kernel version free memory performance statistics and drivers currently  numing  not all the inode numbers in this range are reserved the kernel can allocate  new proc inode mappings dynamically maintaining a bitmap of allocated  in ode numbers it also maintains a tree data structure of registered global i pro c  file system entries each entry contains the file s in ode number file name and  access permissions along with the special functions used to generate the file s  contents drivers can register and deregister entries in this tree at any time  and a special section of the tree appearing under the proc sys directory\\xad is reserved for kernel variables files under this tree are managed by a set  of common handlers that allow both reading and writing of these variables  so a system administrator can tune the value of kernel parameters simply by  writing the new desired values out in ascii decimal to the appropriate file  to allow efficient access to these variables from within applications the   proc sys subtree is made available through a special system call sysctl   that reads and writes the same variables in binary rather than in text without  the overhead of the file system sysctl is not an extra facility it simply reads  the proc dynamic entry tree to identify the variables to which the application  is referring  to the user the i o system in linux looks much like that in any unix system  that is to the extent possible all device drivers appear as normal files users  can open an access channel to a device in the same way they opens any  other file devices can appear as objects within the file system the system  administrator can create special files within a file system that contain references  to a specific device driver and a user opening such a file will be able to read  from and write to the device referenced by using the normal file protection  system which determines who can access which file the administrator can set  access permissions for each device  linux splits all devices into three classes block devices character devices  and network devices figure illustrates the overall structure of the  device driver system  include all devices that allow random access to completely  independent fixed sized blocks of data including hard disks and floppy disks  cd roms and flash memory block devices are typically used to store file  systems but direct access to a block device is also allowed so that programs  can create and repair the file system that the device contains applications can  also access these block devices directly if they wish for example a database  application may prefer to perform its own fine tuned laying out of data onto  the disk rather than using the general purpose file system  include most other devices such as mice and keyboards  the fundamental difference between block and character devices is random  access block devices may be accessed randomly while character devices are  only accessed serially for example seeking to a certain position in a file might  be supported for a dvd but makes no sense to a pointil g device such as a  mouse  are dealt with differently from block and character  devices users cannot directly transfer data to network devices instead  they must communicate indirectly by opening a connection to the kernel s  networking subsystem we discuss the interface to network devices separately  in section   block devices  block devices provide the main interface to all disk devices in a system  performance is particularly important for disks and the block device system  must provide functionality to ensure that disk access is as fast as possible this  functionality is achieved through the scheduling of i operations  in the context of block devices a block represents the unit with which the  kernel performs i wlen a block is read into memory it is stored in a buffer  the request manager is the layer of software that manages the reading and  writing of buffer contents to and from a block device driver  a separate list of requests is kept for each block device driver traditionally  these requests have been scheduled according to a unidirectional elevator   chapter   c scan algorithm that exploits the order in which requests are inserted in  and removed from the lists the request lists are maintained in sorted order of  increasing starting sector number when a request is accepted for processing  by a block device driver it is not removed fronc the list it is rernoved only after  the i o is complete at which point the driver continues with the next request  in the list even if new requests have been inserted into the list before the active  request as new i requests are made the request ncanager attempts to merge  requests in the lists  the scheduling of i operations changed somewhat with version of  the kernel the fundamental problem with the elevator algorithm is that i  operations concentrated in a specific region of the disk can result in starvation  of requests that need to occur in other regions of the disk the deadline  i o scheduler used in version works similarly to the elevator algorithm  except that it also associates a deadline with each request thus addressing  the starvation issue by default the deadline for read requests is second  and that for write requests is seconds the deadline sched uler maintains a  sorted queue of pending i operations ordered by sector number however  it also maintains two other queues a read queue for read operations and a  write queue for write operations these two queues are ordered according to  deadline every i request is placed in both the sorted queue and either the  read or the write queue as appropriate ordinarily i operations occur from  the sorted queue however if a deadline expires for a request in either the read  or the write queue i o operations are scheduled from the queue containing the  expired request this policy ensures that an i operation will wait no longer  than its expiration time   character devices  a character device driver can be almost any device driver that does not offer  random access to fixed blocks of data any character device drivers registered  to the lim jx kernel must also register a set of functions that implement the  file i operations that the driver can handle the kernel performs almost no  preprocessing of a file read or write request to a character device it simply  passes the request to the device in question and lets the device deal with the  request  the main exception to this rule is the special subset of character device  drivers that implement terminal devices the kernel maintains a standard  interface to these drivers by means of a set of tty struct structures each of  these structures provides buffering and flow control on the data stream from  the terminal device and feeds those data to a line discipline  a is an interpreter for the information from the terminal  device the most common line discipline is the tty discipline which glues the  terminal s data stream onto the standard input and output streams of a user s  running processes allowing those processes to communicate directly with the  user s terminal this job is complicated by the fact that several such processes  may be running simultaneously and the tty line discipline is responsible for  attaching and detaching the terminal s input and output from the various  processes connected to it as those processes are suspended or awakened by the  user     other line disciplines also are implemented that have nothing to do with  i to a user process the ppp and sup networking protocols are ways of  encoding a networking connection over a terminal device such as a serial  line these protocols are implemented under linux as drivers that at one end  appear to the terminal system as line disciplines and at the other end appear  to the networking system as network device drivers after one of these line  disciplines has been enabled on a terminal device any data appearing on that  terminal will be routed directly to the appropriate network device driver  linux provides a rich environment for processes to communicate with each  other communication may be just a matter of letting another process know  that some event has occurred or it may involve transferring data from one  process to another   synchronization and signals  the standard lim ix mechanism for informing a process that an event has  occurred is the signals can be sent from any process to any other  process with restrictions on signals sent to processes owned by another user  however a limited number of signals are available and they cannot carry  information only the fact that a signal has occurred is available to a process  sigrl als are not generated only by processes the kernel also generates signals  internally for example it can send a signal to a server process when data  arrive on a network channel to a parent process when a child terminates or to  a waiting process when a timer expires  internally the linux kernel does not use signals to communicate with  processes ruml ing in kernel mode if a kernel mode process is expecting an  event to occm it will not normally use signals to receive notification of that  event rather communication about incoming asynchronous events within  the kernel takes place through the use of scheduling states and wai t queue  structures these mechanisms allow kernel mode processes to inform one  another about relevant events and they also allow events to be generated  by device drivers or by the networking system whenever a process wants to  wait for some event to complete it places itself on a wait queue associated with  that event and tells the scheduler that it is no longer eligible for execution once  the event has completed it will wake up every process on the wait this  procedure allows multiple processes to wait for a single event for  if several processes are trying to read a file from a disk then they will  awakened once the data have been read into memory successfully  although signals have always been the main mechanism for commu\\xad nicating asynchronous events among processes linux also implements the  semaphore mechanism of system v unix a process can wait on a semaphore  as easily as it can wait for a signal but semaphores have two advantages large  numbers of semaphores can be shared among multiple independent processes  and operations on multiple semaphores can be performed atomically inter\\xad nally the standard linux wait queue mechanism synchronizes processes that  are communicating with semaphores   chapter    passing of data among processes  linux offers several mechanisms for passing data among processes the stan\\xad dard unix mechanism allows a child process to inherit a communication  channel from its parent data written to one end of the pipe can be read at the  other under lim jx pipes appear as just another type of inode to virtual file\\xad system software and each pipe has a pair of wait queues to synchronize the  reader and writer unix also defines a set of networking facilities that can send  streams of data to both local and remote processes networking is covered in  section  another process communications method shared memory offers an  extremely fast way to communicate large or small amounts of data any data  written by one process to a shared memory region can be read immediately by  any other process that has mapped that region into its address space the main  disadvantage of shared memory is that on its own it offers no synchronization  a process can neither ask the operating system whether a piece of shared  memory has been written to nor suspend execution until such a write occurs  shared memory becomes particularly powerful when used in conjunction with  another interprocess communication mechanism that provides the missing  synchronization  a shared memory region in linux is a persistent object that can be created  or deleted by processes such an object is treated as though it were a small  independent address space the linux paging algorithms can elect to page  out to disk shared memory pages just as they can page out a process s data  pages the shared memory object acts as a backing store for shared memory  regions just as a file can act as a backing store for a memory mapped memory  region when a file is mapped into a virtual address space region then any  page faults that occur cause the appropriate page of the file to be mapped into  virtual memory similarly shared memory mappings direct page faults to map  in pages from a persistent shared memory object also just as for files shared\\xad memory objects remember their contents even if no processes are currently  mapping them into virtual memory  networking is a key area of functionality for linux not only does linux  support the standard internet protocols used for most unix to unix com\\xad munications but it also implements a number of protocols native to other  non unix operating systems in particular since linux was originally imple\\xad mented primarily on pcs rather than on large workstations or on server class  systems it supports many of the protocols typically used on pc networks such  as appletalk and ipx  internally networking in the linux kernel is implemented by three layers  of software  the socket interface  protocol drivers  network device drivers    user applications perform all networking requests through the socket  interface this interface is designed to look like the bsd socket layer so  that any programs designed to make use of berkeley sockets will run on linux  without any source code changes this interface is described in section a  the bsd socket interface is sufficiently general to represent network addresses  for a wide range of networking protocols this single interface is used in linux  to access not just those protocols implemented on standard bsd systems but all  the protocols supported by the system  the next layer of software is the protocol stack which is similar in  organization to bsd sown framework whenever any networking data arrive at  this either from an application s socket or from a network device driver  the data are expected to have been tagged with an identifier specifying which  network protocol they contain protocols can communicate with one another  if they desire for example within the internet protocol set separate protocols  manage routing error reporting and reliable retransmission of lost data  the protocol layer may rewrite packets create new packets split or  reassemble packets into fragments or simply discard incoming data ulti\\xad mately once the protocol layer has finished processing a set of packets it  passes them on upward to the socket interface if the data are destined for  a local connection or downward to a device driver if the data need to be  transmitted remotely the protocol layer decides to which socket or device it  will send the packet  all communication between the layers of the networking stack is per\\xad formed by passing single skbuff socket buffer structures each of these  structures contains a set of pointers into a single continuous area of memory  representing a buffer inside which network packets can be constructed the  valid data in a skbuff do not need to start at the beginning of the skbuff s  buffer and they do not need to run to the end the networking code can  add data to or trim data from either end of the packet as long as the result  still fits into the skbuff this capacity is especially important on modern  microprocessors where improvements in cpu speed have far outstripped the  performance of main memory the skbuff architecture allows flexibility in  manipulating packet headers and checksums while avoiding any unnecessary  data copying  the most important set of protocols in the linux networking system is the  tcp ip protocol suite this suite comprises a number of separate protocols  the ip protocol implements routing between different hosts anywhere on the  network on top of the routing protocol are built the udp tcp and icmp  protocols the udp protocol carries arbitrary individual datagrams between  hosts the tcp protocol implements reliable connections between hosts with  guaranteed in order delivery of packets and automatic retransmission of lost  data the icmp protocol is used to carry various error and status messages  between hosts  each packet skbuff arriving at the networking stack s protocol software  is expected to be already tagged with an internal identifier indicating the  protocol to which the packet is relevant different networking device drivers  encode the protocol type in different ways thus the protocol for incoming  data must be identified in the device driver the device driver uses a hash table  of known networking protocol identifiers to look up the appropriate protocol   chapter   and passes the packet to that protocol new protocols can be added to the hash  table as kernel loadable modules  incoming ip packets are delivered to the ip driver the job of this layer  is to perform routing after deciding where the packet is to be sent the ip  driver forwards the packet to the appropriate internal protocol driver to be  delivered locally or injects it back into a selected network device driver queue  to be forwarded to another host it performs the routing decision using two  tables the persistent forwarding information base fib and a cache of recent  routing decisions the fib holds routing configuration information and can  specify routes based either on a specific destination address or on a wildcard  representing multiple destinations the fib is organized as a set of hash tables  indexed by destination address the tables representing the most specific routes  are always searched first successful lookups from this table are added to  the route caching table which caches routes only by specific destination no  wildcards are stored in the cache so lookups can be ncade quickly an entry in  the route cache expires after a fixed period with no hits  at various the ip software passes packets to a separate section  of code for management selective filtering of packets according  to arbitrary criteria usually for purposes the firewall manager  maintains a number of separate chain§ and allows a skbuff to be  matched against any chain chains are reserved for separate purposes one is  used for forwarded packets one for packets being input to this host and one  for data generated at this host each chain is held as an ordered list of rules  where a rule specifies one of a number of possible firewall decision functions  plus some arbitrary data for matching purposes  two other functions performed by the ip driver are disassembly and  reassembly of large packets if an outgoing packet is too large to be queued to  a device it is simply split up into smaller fragments which are all queued to  the driver at the receiving host these fragments must be reassembled the ip  driver maintains an ipfrag object for each fragment awaiting reassembly and  an ipq for each datagram being assembled incoming fragments are matched  against each known ipq if a match is found the fragment is added to it  otherwise a new ipq is created once the final fragment has arrived for a  ipq a completely new skbuff is constructed to hold the new packet and this  packet is passed back into the ip driver  packets identified by the ip as destined for this host are passed on to one  of the other protocol drivers the udp and tcp protocols share a means of  associating packets with source and destination sockets each connected pair  of sockets is uniquely identified by its source and destination addresses and  by the source and destination port numbers the socket lists are linked to  hash tables keyed on these four address port values for socket lookup on  incoming packets the tcp protocol has to deal with unreliable connections so  it maintains ordered lists of unacknowledged outgoing packets to retransmit  after a timeout and of incoming out of order packets to be presented to the  socket when the missing data have arrived  linux s security model is closely related to typical unix security mechanisms  the security concerns can be classified in two groups    authentication making sure that nobody can access the system without  first proving that she has entry rights  access control providing a mechanism for checking whether a user has  the right to access a certain object and preventing access to objects as  required   authentication  authentication in unix has typically been performed through the use of a  publicly readable password file a user s password is combined with a random   salt value and the result is encoded with a one way transformation function  and stored in the password file the use of the one way function means that  the original password camot be deduced from the password file except by  trial and error when a user presents a password to the system the password is  recombined with the salt value stored in the password file and passed through  the same one way transformation if the result matches the contents of the  password file then the password is accepted  historically unix implementations of this mechanism have had several  problems passwords were often limited to eight characters and the number  of possible salt values was so low that an attacker could easily combine a  dictionary of commonly used passwords with every possible salt value and  have a good chance of matching one or more passwords in the password  file gaining lmauthorized access to any accounts compromised as a result  extensions to the password mechanism have been introduced that keep the  encrypted password secret in a file that is not publicly readable that allow  longer passwords or that use more secure methods of encoding the password  other authentication mechanisms have been introduced that limit the times  during which a user is permitted to connect to the system also mechanisms  exist to distribute authentication information to all the related systems in a  network  a new security mechanism has been developed by unix vendors to  address authentication problems the  system is based on a shared library that can be used by any system  component that needs to authenticate users an implementation of this system  is available under linux pam allows authentication modules to be loaded on  demand as specified in a system wide configuration file if a new authentication  mechanism is added at a later date it can be added to the configuration file  and all system components will immediately be able to take advantage of it  pam modules can specify authentication methods account restrictions session\\xad setup functions and password changing functions so that when users change  their passwords all the necessary authentication mechanisms can be updated  at once   access control  access control under unix systems including linux is performed through the  use of unique numeric identifiers a user identifier uid identifies a single user  or a single set of access rights a group identifier gid is an extra identifier  that can be used to identify rights belonging to more than one user   chapter  access control is applied to various objects in the system every file  available in the system is protected by the standard access control mecha\\xad nism in addition other shared objects such as shared memory sections and  semaphores employ the same access system  every object in a unix system under user and group access control has a  single uid and a single gid associated with it user processes also have a single  uid but they may have more than one gid if a process s uid matches the uid  of an object then the process has or to that object  if the uids do not match but any gid of the process matches the gid  then are conferred otherwise the process has to the  object  linux performs access control by assigning objects a that  specifies which access modes read write or execute are to be granted to  processes with owner group or world access thus the owner of an object  might have full read write and execute access to a file other users in a certain  group might be given read access but denied write access and everybody else  might be given no access at all  the only exception is the privileged uid a process with this special  uid is granted automatic access to any object in the system bypassing  normal access checks such processes are also granted permission to perform  privileged operations such as reading any physical memory or opening  reserved network sockets this mechanism allows the kernel to prevent normal  users from accessing these resources most of the kernel s key internal resources  are implicitly owned by the root uid  linux implements the standard unix setuid mechanism described in  section a this mechanism allows a program to run with privileges different  from those of the user running the program for example the lpr program   which submits a job to a print queue has access to the system s print queues  even if the user running that program does not the unix implementation of  setuid distinguishes between a process s real and effective uid the real uid  is that of the user running the program the effective uid is that of the file s  owner  under linux this mechanism is augmented in two ways first linux  implements the posix specification s saved user id mechanism which  allows a process to drop and reacquire its effective uid repeatedly for security  reasons a program may want to perform most of its operations in a safe  mode waiving the privileges granted by its setuid status but it may wish  to perform selected operations with all its privileges standard unix imple\\xad mentations achieve this capacity only by swapping the real and effective uids  the previous effective uid is remembered but the program s real uid does not  always correspond to the uid of the user running the program saved uids  allow a process to set its effective uid to its real uid and then back to the  previous value of its effective uid without having to modify the real uid at any  time  the second enhancement provided by linux is the addition of a process  characteristic that grants just a subset of the rights of the effective uid the  and process properties are used when access rights are granted  to files the appropriate property is set every time the effective uid or gid is  set however the fsuid and fsgid can be set independently of the effective ids  allowing a process to access files on behalf of another user without taking on the  identity of that other user in any other way specifically server processes can  use this mechanism to serve files to a certain user without becoming vulnerable  to being killed or suspended by that user  finally linux provides a mechanism for flexible passing of rights from  one program to another a mechanism that has become common in modern  versions of unix when a local network socket has been set up between any  two processes on the system either of those processes may send to the other  process a file descriptor for one of its open files the other process receives a  duplicate file descriptor for the same file this mechanism allows a client to  pass access to a single file selectively to some server process without granting  that process any other privileges for example it is no longer necessary for a  print server to be able to read all the files of a user who submits a new print  job the print client can simply pass the server file descriptors for any files to  be printed denying the server access to any of the user s other files  linux is a modern free operating system based on unix standards it has been  designed to run efficiently and reliably on common pc hardware it also runs  on a variety of other platforms it provides a programming interface and user  interface compatible with standard unix systems and can run a large number of  unix applications including an increasing number of comm ercially supported  applications  linux has not evolved in a vacuum a complete linux system includes  many components that were developed independently of linux the core  linux operating system kernel is entirely original but it allows much existing  free unix software to run resulting in an entire unix compatible operating  system free from proprietary code  the linux kernel is implemented as a traditional monolithic kernel for  performance reasons but it is modular enough in design to allow most drivers  to be dynamically loaded and unloaded at run time  linux is a multiuser system providing protection between processes and  running multiple processes according to a time sharing scheduler

management system uses page sharing and copy on write  to minimize the duplication of data shared by different processes pages are  loaded on demand when they are first referenced and are paged back out to  backing store according to an lfu algorithm if physical memory needs to be  reclaimed  to the user the file system appears as a hierarchical directory tree that  obeys unix semantics internally linux uses an abstraction layer to manage  multiple file systems device oriented networked and virtual file systems are  supported device oriented file systems access disk storage through a

and later  microprocessors the successor to windows nt and windows windows  xp is also intended to replace the windows operating system in this  chapter we discuss the key goals of windows xp the layered architecture of  the system that has made it so easy to use the file system the networking  features and the programming interface  to explore the principles underlying windows xp s design and the specific  components of the system  to explain how windows xp can run programs designed for other operating  systems  to provide a detailed discussion of the windows xp file system  to illustrate the networking protocols supported in windows xp  to describe the interface available to system and application programmers  in the mid s microsoft and ibm cooperated to develop the os operating  system which was written in assembly language for single processor intel   systems in microsoft decided to make a fresh start and to develop  a new technology or nt portable operating system that supported both the  os and posix application programming interfaces apis in october  dave cutler the architect of the dec vax vms operating system was hired  and given the charter of building this new operating system  originally the team planned to use the os api as nts native environment  but during development nt was changed to use the bit windows api or  win api reflecting the popularity of windows the first versions of nt  were windows nt and windows nt advanced server at that time     chapter   bit windows was at version  windows nt version adopted the  windows user interface and incorporated internet web server and web\\xad browser software in addition user interface routines and all graphics code  were moved into the kernel to improve performance with the side effect of  decreased system reliability although previous versions of nt had been ported  to other microprocessor architectures the windows version released  in february supported only intel and compatible processors due to  marketplace factors windows incorporated significant changes it added  active directory an x soo based directory service better networking and  laptop support support for plug and play devices a distributed file system  and support for more processors and more memory  in october windows xp was released as both an update to the  windows desktop operating system and a replacement for windows   in the server versions of windows xp became available called  windows net server windows xp updated the graphical user interface   gui with a visual design that took advantage of more recent hardware  advances and many new numerous features were added  to automatically repair problems in applications and the operating system  itself as a result of these changes windows xp provides better networking and  device experience including zero configuration wireless instant messaging  streaming media and digital photography video dramatic performance  improvements for both the desktop and large multiprocessors and better  reliability and security than earlier windows operating systems  windows xp uses a client server architecture like mach to implement  multiple operating system personalities such as win api and posix with  user level processes called subsystems the subsystem architecture allows  enhancements to be made to one operating system personality without affect\\xad ing the application compatibility of any others  windows xp is a multiuser operating system supporting simultaneous  access through distributed services or through multiple instances of the  graphical user interface via the windows terminal server the server versions  of wil dows xp support simultaneous terminal server sessions from windows  desktop systems the desktop versions of terminal server multiplex the  keyboard mouse and monitor between virtual terminal sessions for each  logged on user this feature called fast user switching allows users to preempt  each other at the console of a pc without having to log off and onto the system  windows xp was the first version of windows to ship a bit version  the native nt file system and many of the win apis have always  used bit integers where appropriate so the major extension to bit in  wil dows xp was support for large addresses  there are two desktop versions of windows xp windows xp professional  is the premium desktop system for power users at work and at home windows  xp personal provides the reliability and ease of use of windows xp but lacks  the more advanced features needed to work seamlessly with active directory  or run posix applications  the mernbers of the windows net server family use the same core  components as the desktop versions but add a range of features needed for  uses such as webserver farms print file servers clustered systems and large  datacenter machines the large datacenter machines can have up to gb of     memory and processors on ia systems and gb and processors on  ia systems  microsoffs design goals for windows xp included security reliability win\\xad dows and posix application compatibility high performance extensibility  portability and international support we discuss each of these goals in the  following sections   security  windows xp goals required more than just adherence to the design  standards that had enabled windows nt to receive a c security classifica\\xad tion from the u s government which signifies a moderate level of protection  from defective software and malicious attacks extensive code review and  testing were combined with sophisticated automatic analysis tools to identify  and investigate potential defects that might represent security vuherabilities   reliability  windows was the most reliable stable operating system microsoft had  ever shipped to that point much of this reliability came from maturity in the  source code extensive stress testing of the and automatic detection  of many serious errors in drivers the requirements for windows  xp were even more stringent microsoft used extensive manual and automatic  code review to identify over lines in the source files that might contain  issues not detected by testing and then set about reviewing each area to verify  that the code was indeed correct  windows xp extended driver verification to catch more subtle bugs  improved the facilities for catching programming errors in user level code  and subjected third party applications drivers and devices to a rigorous  certification process furthermme windows xp added facilities for monitoring  the health of the pc including downloading fixes for problems before they  are encountered by users the perceived reliability of windows xp was also  improved by making the graphical user interface easier to use through better  visual design simpler menus and measured improvements in the ease with  which users can discover how to perform common tasks   windows and posix application compatibility  as mentioned windows xp was not only an update of windows but  also a replacement for windows windows focused primarily on  compatibility for business applications the requirements for windows xp  included a much higher with the consumer applications that ran  on windows is difficult to achieve because  each application checks for a particular version of windows may depend to  some extent on the quirks of the implementation of apis may have latent  application bugs that were masked in the previous system and so forth   chapter  windows xp introduced a compatibility layer that falls between appli\\xad cations and the win apis this layer makes windows xp look almost  bug for bug compatible with previuus versions of windows windows xpf  like earlier nt releasesf maintains support for running many bit applica\\xad tions using a thunkingf or conversionf layer that translates bit api calls into  equivalent bit calls similarlyf the bit version of windows xp provides a  thunking layer that translates bit api calls into native bit calls in additionf  posix support in windows xp was much improved by a new posix subsystem  called interix most available unix compatible software compiles and runs  under interix without modification   high performance  windows xp was designed to provide on desktop systems   which are largely constrained by i performance server systems where the  cpu is often the bottleneck and large multithreaded and multiprocessor envi\\xad ronments where locking and cache line management are keys to scalability  to satisfy performance requirements nt used a variety of techniques such  as asynchronous i optimized protocols for networks kernel based graph\\xad ics and sophisticated caching of file system data the memory management  and synchronization algorithms were designed with an awareness of the  performance considerations related to cache lines and multiprocessors  windows xp further improved performance by reducing the code path  length in critical functionsf using better algorithms and per processor data  structures using memory coloring for numa non uniform nemory access  machines and implementing more scalable locking protocols such as queued  spinlocks the new locking protocols helped reduce system bus cycles and  included lock free lists and queues atomic read modify write operations   like interlocked increment and other advanced locking techniques  the subsystems that constitute windows xp communicate with one another  efficiently through a local procedure call lpc facility that provides high\\xad performance message passing except while executing in the kernel dispatcherf  threads in the subsystems of windows xp can be preempted by higher\\xad priority threads thus the system responds quickly to external events in  addition windows xp was designed for symmetrical multiprocessing on a  multiprocessor computer several threads can run at the same time   extensibility  refers to the capacity of an operating system to keep up with  advances in computing technology to facilitate change over tim e the devel\\xad opers implemented windows xp using a layered architecture the windows  xp executive runs in kernel or protected mode and provides the basic system  services on top of the executive several server subsystems operate in user  mode among them are that emulate different  operating systems thus programs written for ms dos microsoft windowsf  and posix all run on windows xp in the appropriate environment see section   for more information on environmental subsystems because of the mod\\xad ular structure additional environmental subsystems can be added without  affecting the executive in addition windows xp uses loadable drivers in the  i system so new file systems new kinds of i devices and new kinds of     networking can be added while the system is running windows xp uses a  client server model like the mach operating system and supports distributed  processing by remote procedure calls rpcs as defined by the open software  foundation   portability  an operating system is if it can be moved from one hardware  architecture to another with relatively few changes windows xp was designed  to be portable like the unix operating system windows xp is written  primarily in c and c most processor dependent code is isolated in a  dynamic link library dll called the hal a  dll is a file that is mapped into a process s address space in such a way that  any functions in the dll appear to be part of the process the upper layers of the  windows xp kernel depend on the hal interfaces rather than on the underlying  hardware bolstering windows xp portability the hal manipulates hardware  directly isolating the rest of windows xp from hardware differences among  the platforms on which it runs  although for market reasons windows shipped only on intel ia  compatible platforms it was also tested on ia and dec alpha platforms until  just prior to release to ensure portability windows xp runs on ia compatible  and ia processors microsoft recognizes the importance of multiplatform  development and testing since as a practical matter maintaining portability  is a matter of use it or lose it   international support  windows xp was also designed for  provides support for different locales via the  the nls api provides specialized routines to format dates time and money  in accordance with national customs string comparisons are specialized to  accmt for varying character sets unicode is windows xp s native character  code windows xp supports ansi characters by converting them to unicode  characters before manipulating them bit to bit conversion system text  strings are kept in resource files that can be replaced to localize the system  for different languages multiple locales can be used concurrently which is  important to multilingual individuals and businesses  the architecture of windows xp is a layered system of modules as shown in  figure the main layers are the hal the kernel and the executive all  of which run in protected mode and a collection of subsystems and services  that run in user mode the user mode subsystems fall into two categories  the environmental subsystems which emulate different operating systems  and the which provide security functions one of  the chief advantages of type of architecture is that interactions between  modules are kept simple the remainder of this section describes these layers  and subsystems  figure windows xp block diagram   hardware abstraction layer  the hal is the layer of software that hides hardware differences from upper  levels of the operating system to help make windows xp portable the hal  exports a virtual machine interface that is used by the kernel dispatcher the  executive and the device drivers one advantage of this approach is that only  a single version of each device driver is required it runs on all hardware  platforms without porting the driver code the hal also provides support  for symmetric multiprocessing device drivers map devices and access them  directly but the administrative details of mapping memory configuring i  buses setting up dma and coping with motherboard specific facilities are all  provided by the hal interfaces   kernel  the kernel of windows xp has four main responsibilities thread scheduling  interrupt and exception handling low level processor synchronization and  recovery after a power failure the kernel is object oriented an object type in  windows is a system defined data type that has a set of attributes data  values and a set of methods for example functions or operations an object is  an instance of an object type the kernel performs its job by using a set of kernel  objects whose attributes store the kernel data and whose methods perform the  kernel activities     kernel dispatcher  the kernel dispatcher provides the foundation for the executive and the sub\\xad systems most of the dispatcher is never paged out of ncemmy and its execution  is never preempted its main responsibilities are thread sched llling implemen\\xad tation of synchronization primitives timer managencent software interrupts   asynchronous and deferred procedure calls and exception dispatching   threads and scheduling  like many other modern operating systems windows xp uses processes and  threads for executable code each process has one or more threads and each  thread has its own scheduling state including actual priority processor affinity  and cpu usage information  there are six possible thread states ready standby running waiting  transition and terminated indicates that the thread is waiting to run  the highest priority ready thread is moved to the state which means  it is the next thread to run in a multiprocessor system each process keeps  one thread in a standby state a thread is when it is executing on  a processor it runs until it is preempted thread until it  terminates until its allotted execution time ends or until it blocks  on a dispatcher object such as an event signaling i completion a thread is  in the state when it is waiting for a dispatcher object to be signaled a  new thread is in the state while it waits for resources necessary for  execution a thread enters the state when it finishes execution  the dispatcher uses a level priority scheme to determine the order of  thread execution priorities are divided into two classes variable class and  real time class the variable class contains threads having priorities from to   and the real time class contains threads with priorities ranging from  to the dispatcher uses a queue for each scheduling priority and traverses  the set of queues from highest to lowest until it finds a thread that is ready  to run if a thread has a particular processor affinity but that processor is not  available the dispatcher skips past it and continues looking for a ready thread  that is willing to run on the available processor if no ready thread is found  the dispatcher executes a special thread called the idle thread  when a thread s time quantum runs out the clock interrupt queues a  quantum end deferred procedure call dpc to the processor in order to  reschedule the processor if the preempted thread is in the variable priority  class its priority is lowered the priority is never lowered below the base  priority lowering the thread s priority tends to limit the cpu consumption of  compute bound threads when a variable priority thread is released from a  wait operation the dispatcher boosts the priority the amount of the boost  depends on the device for which the thread was waiting for example a  thread waiting for keyboard i would get a large priority increase whereas  a thread waiting for a disk operation would get a moderate one this strategy  tends to give good response times to interactive threads using a mouse and  windows it also enables i o bound threads to keep the i o devices busy while  permitting compute bound threads to use spare cpu cycles in the background  this strategy is used by several time sharing operating systems including  unix in addition the thread associated with the user s active gui window  receives a priority boost to enhance its response time   chapter  scheduling occurs when a thread enters the ready or wait state when  a thread terminates or when an application changes a thread s priority or  processor affinity if a higher priority real tince thread becomes ready while  a lower priority thread is running the lower priority thread is preempted  this preemption gives a real time thread preferential access to the cpu when  the thread needs such access windows xp is not a hard real time operating  system however because it does not guarantee that a real time thread will  start to execute within a particular time limit   implementation of synchronization primitives  key operating system data structures are managed as objects using common  facilities for allocation reference counting and security  control dispatching and synchronization in the system  examples of these objects include the following  the is used to record an event occurrence and to synchronize  this occurrence with some action notification events signal all waiting  threads and synchronization events signal a single waiting thread  the provides kernel mode or user mode mutual exclusion with  the notion of ownership  the available only in kernel mode provides deadlock free mutual  exclusion  the defsemaphore object acts as a counter or gate to control the number  of threads that access a resource  the is the entity that is scheduled by the kernel dispatcher  and is associated with a which encapsulates a virtual  address space  the is used to keep track of time and to signal timeouts when  operations take too long and need to be interrupted or when a periodic  activity needs to be scheduled  many of the dispatcher objects are accessed from user mode via an open  operation that returns a handle the user mode code polls or waits on handles  to synchronize with other threads as well as with the operating system see  section    software interrupts asynchronous and deferred procedure calls  the dispatcher implements two types of software interrupts asynchronous  procedure calls and deferred procedure calls an asynchronous procedure call   apc breaks into an executing thread and calls a procedure apcs are used to  begin execution of new threads terminate processes and deliver notification  that an asynchronous i has completed apcs are queued to specific threads  and allow the system to execute both system and user code within a process s  context  deferred procedure calls dpcs are used to postpone interrupt processing  after handling all blocked device interrupt processes the interrupt service  routine isr schedules the remaining processing by queuing a dpc the    dispatcher schedules software interrupts at a lower priority than the device  interrupts so that dpcs do not block other lsrs in addition to deferring device\\xad interrupt processing the dispatcher uses dpcs to process timer expirations and  to preempt thread execution at the end of the scheduling quantum  execution of dpcs prevents threads from being scheduled on the current  processor and also keeps apcs from signaling the completion of i this is  done so that completion of dpc routines does not take an extended anwunt of  time as an alternative the dispatcher maintains a pool of worker threads isrs  and dpcs queue work itencs to the worker threads dpc routines are restricted  so that they cannot take page faults be paged out of memory call system  services or take any other action that might possibly result in an attempt to  block execution of a dispatcher object unlike apcs dpc routines make no  assumptions about what process context the processor is executing   exceptions and interrupts  the kernel dispatcher also provides trap handling for exceptions and interrupts  generated by hardware or software windows xp defines several architecture\\xad independent exceptions including  memory access violation  integer overflow  floating point overflow or underflow  integer divide by zero  floating point divide by zero  illegal instruction  data misalignment  privileged instruction  page read error  access violation  paging file quota exceeded  debugger breakpoint  debugger single step  the trap handlers deal with simple exceptions elaborate exception handling  is performed by the kernel s exception dispatcher  when an exception occurs in kernel mode the exception dispatcher simply  calls a routine to locate the exception handler if no handler is found a fatal  system error occurs and the user is left with the infamous blue screen of death  that signifies system failure  exception handling is more complex for user mode processes because  an environmental subsystem such as the posix system sets up a debugger  port and an exception port for every process it creates if a debugger port   chapter  is registered the exception handler sends the exception to the port if the  debugger port is not found or does not handle that exception the dispatcher  attempts to find an appropriate exception handler if no handler is found the  debugger is called again to catch the error for debugging if no debugger  is running a message is sent to the process s exception port to give the  environmental subsystem a chance to translate the exception for example  the posix environment translates windows xp exception messages into posix  signals before sending them to the thread that caused the exception finally  if nothing else works the kernel simply terminates the process containing the  thread that caused the exception  the interrupt dispatcher in the kernel handles interrupts by calling either  an interrupt service routine isr supplied by a device driver or a kernel  trap handler routine the interrupt is represented by an interrupt object that  contains all the information needed to handle the interrupt using an interrupt  object makes it easy to associate interrupt service routines with an interrupt  without having to access the interrupt hardware directly  different processor architectures such as intel and dec alpha have  different types and numbers of interrupts for portability the interrupt  dispatcher maps the hardware interrupts into a standard set the interrupts  are prioritized and are serviced in priority order there are interrupt request  levels irqls in windows xp eight are reserved for use by the kernel the  remaining represent hardware interrupts via the hal although most ia  systems use only the windows xp interrupts are defined in figure  the kernel uses an to bind each interrupt level to  a service routine in a multiprocessor computer windows xp keeps a separate  interrupt dispatch table for each processm and each processor s irql can be set  independently to mask out interrupts all interrupts that occur at a level equal  to or less than the irql of a processor are blocked until the irql is lowered by a  kernel level thread or by an isr returning from interrupt processing windows  xp takes advantage of this property and uses software interrupts to deliver  apcs and dpcs to perform system functions such as synchronizing threads  with i completion to start thread dispatches and to handle timers   machine check or bus error  power fail  interprocessor notification request another processor  to act e g dispatch a process or update

interrupt request levels     executive  the windows xp executive provides a set of services that all enviromnental  subsystems use the services are grouped as follows object manager virtual  memory manager process manager local procedure call facility i o man\\xad ager cache manager security reference monitor plug and play and power  managers registry and booting   object manager  for managing kernel mode entities windows xp uses a generic set of interfaces  that are manipulated by user mode programs windows xp calls these entities  objects and the executive component that manipulates them is the  each process has an object table containing entries that track the  objects used by the process user mode code accesses these objects using an  opaque value called a handle that is returned by many apis object handles can  also be created by duplicating an existing handle either from the same process  or from a different process examples of objects are semaphores mutexes  events processes and threads these are all dispatcher objects threads can  block in the kernel dispatcher waiting for any of these objects to be signaled  the process thread and virtual memory apis use process and thread handles  to identify the process or thread to be operated on other examples of objects  include files sections ports and various internal i o objects file objects are  used to maintain the open state of files and devices sections are used to map  files open files are described in terms of file objects local communication  endpoints are implemented as port objects  the object manager maintains the windows xp internal name space in  contrast to unix which roots the system name space in the file system  windows xp uses an abstract name space and connects the file systems as  devices  the object manager provides interfaces for defining both object types  and object instances translating names to objects maintaining the abstract  name space through internal directories and symbolic links and managing  object creation and deletion objects are typically managed through the use  of reference counts in protected mode code and handles in user mode code  however some kernel mode components use the same apis as user mode code  and thus use handles to manipulate objects if a handle needs to exist beyond  the lifetime of the current process it is marked as a kernel handle and stored  in the object table for the system process the abstract name space does not  persist across reboots but is built up from configuration information stored in  the system registry plug and play device discovery and creation of objects by  system components  the windows xp executive allows any object to be given a one  process ncay create a named object while a second process opens a handle to  the object and shares it with the first process processes can also share objects  by duplicating handles between processes in which case the objects need not  be named  a name can be either permanent or temporary a perrnanent name  represents an entity such as a disk drive that remains even if no process  is accessing it a temporary nance exists only while a process holds a handle  to the object   chapter  object names are structured like file path names in ms dos and unix name  space directories are represented by a that contains the names  of all the objects in the directory the object name space is extended by the  addition of device objects representing volumes containing file systems  objects are manipulated by a set of virtual functions with implementa\\xad tions provided for each object type create open close delete  query jlame parse and security the latter three functions may need  some explanation  query jlame is called when a thread has a reference to an object but  wants to know the object s name  parse is used by the object manager to search for an object given the  object s name  security is called to make security checks on all object operations such  as when a process opens or closes an object makes changes to the security  descriptor or duplicates a handle for an object  the parse procedure is used to extend the abstract name space to include  files the translation of a path name to a file object begins at the root of  the abstract name space path name components are separated by whack  characters  rather than the slashes  used in unix each component is  looked up in the current parse directory of the name space internal nodes  within the name space are either directories or symbolic links if a leaf object  is found and there are no path name components remaining the leaf object  is returned otherwise the leaf object s parse procedure is invoked with the  remaining path name  parse procedures are only used with a small number of objects belonging  to the wilcdows gui the configuration manager registry and most notably   device objects representing file systems the parse procedure for the device  object type allocates a file object and mitiates an open or create i o operation  on the file system if successful the file object fields are filled in to describe the  file  in summary the path name to a file is used to traverse the object manager  namespace translatilcg the original absolute path name into a device object  relative path name pair this pair is then passed to the file system via the i  manager which fills in the file object the file object itself has no name but is  referred to by a handle  unix file systems have that permit multiple nicknames  or aliases for the same file the implemented by the  windows xp object manager is within the abstract name space not to  provide files with aliases even so symbolic links are very useful they are  used to organize the name space similar to the organization of the devices  directory in unix they are also used to map standard ms dos drive letters to  drive names drive letters are symbolic links that can be remapped to suit the  convenience of the user or administrator  drive letters are one place where the abstract name space in windows xp  is not global each logged on user has his or her own set of drive letters so  that users can avoid interfering with one another in contrast terminal server  sessions share all processes within a session basenamedobj ects contain the  named objects created by most applications    although the name space is not directly visible across a network the object  manager s parse method is used to help access a named object on another  system when a process attencpts to open an object that resides on a remote  computer the object manager calls the parse method for the device object  corresponding to a network redirector this results in an i operation that  accesses the file across the network  as mentioned objects are instances of an the object type  specifies how instances are to be allocated the definitions of the data fields  and the implementation of the standard set of virtual functions used for all  objects these functions implement operations such as mapping names to  objects closing and deleting and applying security  the object manager keeps track of two counts for each object the pointer  count is the number of distinct references made to an object protected mode  code that refers to objects must keep a reference on the objects to ensure that  an object is not deleted while in use the handle count is the number of handle  table entries referring to an object each handle is also reflected in the reference  count  when a handle for an object is closed the object s close routine is called in  the case of file objects this call causes the i manager to do a cleanup operation  at the close of the last handle the cleanup operation tells the file system that the  file is no longer accessed by user mode so that sharing restrictions range locks  and other states specific to the corresponding open routine can be removed  each handle close removes a reference from the pointer count but internal  system components may retain additional references when the final reference  is removed the object s delete procedure is called again using file objects as an  example the delete procedure causes the i manager to send the file system a  close operation on the file object this causes the file system to deallocate any  internal data structures that were allocated for the file object  after the delete procedure for a temporary object completes the object is  deleted from memory the object manager can make an object permanent at  least with respect to the current boot of the system by taking an extra reference  against the object thus permanent objects are not deleted even when the last  reference outside the object manager is removed when a permanent object is  made temporary again the object manager removes the extra reference if this  was the last reference the object is deleted permanent objects are rare used  mostly for devices drive letter mappings and the directory and symbolic link  objects  the job of the object manager is to supervise the use of all managed objects  when a thread wants to use an object it calls the object manager s open  method to get a reference to the object if the object is being opened from a  user mode api the reference is inserted into the process s object table and a  handle is returned  a process gets a handle by creating an object by opening an existing  object by receiving a duplicated handle from another process or by inheriting  a handle from a similar to the way a unix process gets a file  descriptor these handles are all stored in the process s an entry  in the object table contains the access rights and states whether the  handle should be inherited by when a process terminates  windows xp automatically closes all the process s open handles   chapter  are a standardized interface to all kinds of objects like a file  descriptor in unix an object handle is an identifier unique to a process that  confers the ability to access and manipulate a system resource handles can  be duplicated within a process or between processes the latter case is used  whert child processes are created and when out of process execution contexts  are implemented  since the object manager is the only entity that generates object handles  it is the natural place to check security the object manager checks whether  a process has the right to access an object when the process tries to open the  object the object manager also enforces quotas such as the maximum amount  of memory a process may use by charging a process for the memory occupied  by all its referenced objects and refusing to allocate more memory when the  accumulated charges exceed the process s quota  when the login process authenticates a user an access token is attached to  the user s process the access token contains information such as the security  id group ids privileges primary group and default access control list the  services and objects a user can access are determined by these attributes  the token that controls access is associated with the thread making the  access normally the thread token is missing and defaults to the process token  but services often need to execute code on behalf of their clients windows xp  allows threads to impersonate a client temporarily by using a client s token  thus the thread token is not necessarily the same as the process token  in windows xp each object is protected by an access control list that  contains the security ids and access rights granted when a thread attempts  to access an object the system compares the security id in the thread s access  token with the object s access control list to determine whether access should  be permitted the check is performed only when an object is opened so it is not  possible to deny access after the open occurs operating system components  executing in kernel mode bypass the access check since kernel mode code  is assumed to be trusted therefore kernel mode code must avoid security  vulnerabilities such as leaving checks disabled while creating a user mode\\xad accessible handle in an untrusted process  generally the creator of the object determines the access control list for  the object if none is explicitly supplied one may be set to a default by the  object type s open routine or a default list may be obtained from the user s  access token object  the access token has a field that controls auditing of object accesses  operations that are being audited are logged to the system s security log with  an identification of the user an administrator monitors this log to discover  attempts to break into the system or to access protected objects   virtual memory manager  the executive component that manages the virtual address space physical  memory allocation and paging is the the  design of the vm manager assumes that the underlying hardware supports  virtual to physical mapping a paging mechanisnc and transparent cache  coherence on multiprocessor systems as well as allowing multiple page\\xad table entries to map to the same physical page frame the vm manager in  windows xp uses a page based management scheme with a page size of kb on    la compatible processors and kb on the ia pages of data allocated to a  process that are not in physical memory are either stored in the on  disk or mapped directly to a regular file on a local or remote file system pages  can also be marked zero fill on demand which fills the page with zeros before  they are allocated thus erasing the previous contents  on la processors each process has a gb virtual address space the  upper gb are mostly identical for all processes and are used by windows xp  in kernel mode to access the operating system code and data structures key  areas of the kernel mode region that are not identical for all processes are the  and the hardware references  a process s page using physical page frame numbers the vm manager  maps the page tables into a single mb region in the process s address space  so they are accessed through virtual addresses hyperspace maps the current  process s working set information into the kernel mode address space  session space is used to share the win and other session specific drivers  among all the processes in the same terminal server session rather than all the  processes in the system the lower gb are specific to each process and are  accessible by both user and kernel mode threads certain configurations of  windows xp reserve only gb for operating system use allowing a process to  use gb of address space ruming the system in gb mode drastically reduces  the amount of data caching in the kernel however for large applications  that manage their own i such as sql databases the advantage of a larger  user mode address space may be worth the loss of caching  the windows xp vm manager uses a two step process to allocate user  memory the first step reserves a portion of the process s virtual address space  the second step commits the allocation by assigning virtual memory space   physical memory or space in the paging files windows xp limits the amount  of virtual memory space a process consumes by enforcing a quota on committed  memory a process decommits memory that it is no longer using to free up  virtual memory for use by other processes the apis used to reserve virtual  addresses and commit virtual memory take a handle on a process object as a  parameter this allows one process to control the virtual memory of another  environmental subsystems manage the memory of their client processes in this  way  for performance the vm manager allows a privileged process to lock  selected pages in physical memory thus ensuring that the pages are not paged  out to the paging file processes also allocate raw physical mernory and then  map regions into its virtual address space ia processors with the physical  address extension pae feature can have up to gb of physical memory on a  system this memory cannot all be mapped in a process s address space at once  but windows xp makes it available using the address windowing extension   awe apis which allocate physical memory and then map regions of virtual  addresses in the process s address space onto part of the physical memory  the awe facility is used primarily by very large applications such as the sql  database  windows xp implements shared memory by defining a  after getting a handle to a section object a process maps the memory portion  it needs into its address space this portion is called a a process redefines  its view of an object to gain access to the entire object one region at a time   chapter  a process can control the use of a shared memory section object in many  ways the maximum size of a section can be bounded the section can be  backed by disk either in the system paging file or in a regular file a  a section can be based meaning the section appears  at the same virtual address for all processes attempting to access it finally  the memory protection of pages in the section can be set to read only read   write read write execute execute only no access or copy on write let s  look more closely at the last two of these protection settings  a no access page raises an exception if accessed the exception is used for  example to check whether a faulty program iterates beyond the end of  an array both the user mode memory allocator and the special kernel  allocator used by the device verifier can be configured to map each  allocation onto the end of a page followed by a no access page to detect  buffer overruns  the copy on write mechanism enables the vm manager to use physical  memory more efficiently when two processes want independent copies of  an object the vm manager places a single shared copy into virtual memory  and activates the copy on write property for that region of memory if one  of the processes tries to modify data in a copy on write page the vm  manager makes a private copy of the page for the process  the virtual address translation in windows xp uses a multilevel page  table for ia processors without the physical address extensions enabled  each process has a that contains   pdes bytes in size each pde points to a that contains   bytes in size each pte points to a kb  in physical memory the total size of all page tables for a process is mb so the  vm manager pages out individual tables to disk when necessary see figure   for a diagram of this structure  the page directory and page tables are referenced by the hardware via  physical addresses to improve performance the vm manager self maps  the page directory and page tables into a mb region of virtual addresses  the self map allows the vm manager to translate a virtual address into the  corresponding pde or pte without additional memory accesses when a process  context is changed a single page directory entry must be changed to map the  new process s page tables for a variety of reasons the hardware requires that  each page directory or page table occupy a sii gle page thus the number of  pdes or ptes that fit in a page determine how virtual addresses are translated  we next consider how virtual addresses are translated into physical  addresses on ia compatible processors without pae enabled a bit value  can represent all the values from to thus a bit value can select any  entry in the page directory or in a page table this property is used when a  virtual address pointer is translated to a byte address in physical memory a   bit virtual memory address is split into three values as shown in figure   the first bits of the virtual address are used as an index into the page  directory this address selects one page directory entry pde which contains  the physical page frame of a page table the memory management unit mmu  uses the next bits of the virtual address to select a pte from the page table    figure page table layout  the pte specifies a page frame in physical memory the remaining bits of  the virtual address are the offset of a specific byte in the page frame the mmu  creates a pointer to the specific byte in physical memory by concatenating the   bits from the pte with the lower bits from the virtual address thus  the bit pte has bits to describe the state of the physical page the ia  hardware reserves bits for use by the operating system the rest of the bits  specify whether the page has been accessed or written the caching attributes  the access mode whether the page is globat and whether the pte is valid  ia processors running with pae enabled use bit pdes and ptes in  order to represent the larger bit page frame number field thus the second\\xad level page directories and the page tables contain only pdes and ptes  respectively to provide gb of virtual address space requires an extra level of  page directory containing four pdes translation of a bit virtual address uses   bits for the top level directory index and bits for each of the second level  page directories and the page tables  to avoid the overhead of translating every virtual address by looking  up the pde and pte processors use a  which contains an associative memory cache for mapping virtual pages to  ptes unlike the ia architecture in which the tlb is maintained by the    figure virtual to physical address translation on ia   chapter  hardware mmu the ta invokes a software trap routine to supply translations  missing from the tlb this gives the vm manager flexibility in choosing the  data structures to use in windows xp a three level tree structure is chosen for  rnapping user mode virtual addresses on the ia  on ia processors the page size is kb but the ptes occupy bits so a  page still contains only  bits worth of pdes or ptes therefore with   bits of top level pdes bits of second level pdes bits of page table and   bits of page offset the user portion of the process s virtual address space  for windows xp on the ia is tb bits worth the tb limitation in the  current version of windows xp does not take full advantage of the capabilities  of the ia processor but represents a tradeoff between the number of memory  references required to handle tlb misses and the size of the user mode address  space supported  a physical page can be in one of six states valid free zeroed modified  standby bad or in transition  a valid page is in use by an active process  a free page is a page that is not referenced in a pte  a zeroed page is a free page that has been zeroed out and is ready for  immediate use to satisfy zero on demand faults  a modified page has been written by a process and must be sent to the disk  before it is allocated for another process  a standby page is a copy of information already stored on disk standby  pages can be pages that were not modified modified pages that have  already been written to the disk or pages that were prefetched to exploit  locality  a bad page is unusable because a hardware error has been detected  finally a transition page is on its way in from disk to a page frame allocated  in physical memory  when the valid bit in a pte is zero the vm manager defines the format of  the other bits invalid pages can have a number of states represented by bits in  the pte page file pages that have never been faulted in are marked zero on\\xad demand files mapped through section objects encode a pointer to that section  object pages that have been written to the page file contain enough information  to find the page on disk and so forth  the actual structure of the page file pte is shown in figure the pte  contains bits for page protection bits for page file offset bits to select the  paging file and bits that describe the page state a page file pte is marked to  be an invalid virtual address to the mmu since executable code and memory\\xad mapped files already have a copy on disk they do not need space in a paging  file i£ one of these pages is not in physical memory the pte structure is as  follows the most significant bit is used to specify the page protection the next   bits are used to index into a system data structure that indicates a file and  offset within the file for the page and the lower bits specify the page state  invalid virtual addresses can also be in a number of temporary states that  are part of the paging algorithms when a page is removed from a processs      figure page file page table entry the valid bit is zero  working set it is moved either to the modified list to be written to disk or  directly to the standby list if written to the standby list the page is reclaimed  without being read from disk if it is needed again before it is moved to the free  list when possible the vm manager uses idle cpu cycles to zero pages on the  free list and move them to the zeroed list transition pages have been allocated  a physical page and are awaiting the completion of the paging i before the  pte is marked as valid  windows xp uses section objects to describe pages that are sharable  between processes each process has its own set of virtual page tables but  the section object also includes a set of page tables containing the master or  prototype pies when a pte in a process page table is marked valid it points  to the physical page frame containing the page as it must on ia processors  where the hardware mmu reads the page tables directly from memory but  when a shared page is made invalid the pte is edited to point to the prototype  pte associated with the section object  the page tables associated with a section object are virtual insofar as they  are created and trimmed as needed the only prototype pies needed are  those that describe pages for which there is a currently mapped view this  greatly improves performance and allows more efficient use of kernel virtual  addresses  the prototype pte contains the page frame address and the protection  and state bits thus the first access by a process to a shared page generates a  page fault after the first access further accesses are performed in the normal  manner if a process writes to a copy on write page marked read only in the  pte the vm manager makes a copy of the page and marks the pte writable  and the process effectively does not have a shared page any longer shared  pages never appear in the page file but are instead found in the file system  the vm manager keeps track of all pages of physical m emory in a  there is one entry for every page of physical memory in  system the entry points to the pte which in turn points to the page frame so  the vm n anager can maintain the state of the page page frames not referenced  by a valid pte are linked to lists according to page type such as zeroed  modified or free  if a shared physical page is marked as valid for any process the page  cannot be removed from memory the vm manager keeps a count of valid pies  for each page in the page frame database when the count goes to zero the  physical page can be reused once its contents have been written back to disk   if it was marked dirty  when a page fault occurs the vm manager finds a physical page to hold  the data for zero on demand pages the first choice is to find a page that has   chapter  already been zeroed if none is available a page from the free list or standby  list is chosen and the page is zeroed if the faulted page has been marked as in  transition it is either already being read in fron disk or has been unmapped or  trimmed and is still available on the standby or modified list the thread either  waits for the l to complete or in the latter cases reclaims the page from the  appropriate list  otherwise an i must be issued to read the page in from the paging file or  file systein the vm manager tries to allocate an available page from either the  free list or the standby list pages in the modified list cannot be used until they  have been written back to disk and transferred to the standby list if no pages  are available the thread blocks until the working set manager trims pages from  memory or until a page in physical memory is unmapped by a process  windows xp uses a per process first in first out fifo replacement policy  to take pages from processes as appropriate when a process is started it  is assigned a default minimum working set size of pages windows xp  monitors the page faulting of each process that is at its minimum working set  size and adjusts the working set size accordingly the vm manager replaces  and trims pages in the working set of a process according to their age the age  of a page is determin ed by how many trimming cycles have occurred without  the pte trimmed pages are moved to the standby or modified list depending  on whether the modified bit is set in the page s pte  the vm manager does not fault in only the page immediately needed  research shows that the memory referencing of a thread tends to have a  property when a page is used it is likely that adjacent pages will  be referenced in the near future think of iterating over an array or fetching  sequential instructions that form the executable code for a thread because of  locality when the vm manager faults in a page it also faults in a few adjacent  pages this prefetching tends to reduce the total number of page faults writes  are also clustered to reduce the number of independent t operations  in addition to managing committed memory the vm manager manages  each process s reserved memory or virtual address space each process has an  associated splay tree that describes the ranges of virtual addresses in use and  what the uses are this allows the vm manager to fault in page tables as needed  if the pte for a faulting address does not exist the vm manager searches for  the address in the process s tree of and  uses this information to fill in the missing pte and retrieve the page in some  cases a page table page itself may not exist such a page must be transparently  allocated and initialized by the vm manager   process manager  the windows xp process manager provides services for creating deleting and  using processes threads and jobs it has no kn owledge about parent child  relationships or process hierarchies those refinements are left to the particular  environmental subsystem that owns the process the process manager is also  not involved in the scheduling of processes other than setting the priorities and  affinities in processes and threads when they are created thread scheduling  takes place in the kernel dispatcher  each process contains one or more threads processes themselves can be  collected into large units called the use of job objects allows limits to be placed on cpu usage working set size and processor affinities that control  multiple processes at once job objects are used to manage large data center  machines  an example of process creation in the win api environncent is as follows  a win api application calls createprocess   a message is sent to the win api subsystem to notify it that the process  is being created  createprocess in the original process then calls an api in the process  manager of the nt executive to actually create the process  the process manager calls the object manager to create a process object  and returns the object handle to win api  win api calls the process manager again to create a thread for the process  and returns handles to the new process and thread  the windows xp apis for manipulating virtual memory and threads and  for duplicating handles take a process handle so subsystems can perform  operations on behalf of a new process without having to execute directly in  the new process s context once a new process is created the initial thread  is created and an asynchronous procedure call is delivered to the thread to  prompt the start of execution at the user mode image loader the loader is an  ntdll dll which is a link library automatically mapped into every newly created  process windows xp also supports a unix fork style of process creation in  order to support the posix environmental subsystem although the win api  environment calls the process manager from the client process posix uses the  cross process nature of the windows xp apis to create the new process from  within the subsystem process  the process manager also implements the queuing and delivery of asyn\\xad chronous procedure calls apcs to threads apcs are used by the system to  initiate thread execution complete i terminate threads and processes and  attach debuggers user mode code can also queue an apc to a thread for  delivery of signal like notifications to support posix the process manager  provides apis that send alerts to threads to unblock them from system calls  the debugger support in the process manager includes the capability to  suspend and resume threads and to create threads that begin in a suspended  mode there are also process manager apis that get and set a thread s register  context and access another process s virtual memory  threads can be created in the current process they can also be injected into  another process within the executive existing threads can temporarily attach  to another process this method is used by worker threads that need to execute  in the context of the process originating a work request  the process manager also supports impersonation a thread running in a  process with a security token belonging to one user can set a thread specific  token belonging to another user this facility is fundamental to the client\\xad server computing model where services need to act on behalf of a variety of  clients with different security ids   chapter   local procedure call facility  the implementation of windows xp uses a client server nlodel the environ\\xad n ental subsystems are servers that implement particular operating system  personalities the client server model is used for implementing a variety  of operating system services besides the environmental subsystems security  management printer spooling web services network file systems plug and\\xad play and many other features are implemented using this model to reduce the  memory footprint multiple services are often collected into a few processes  which then rely on the user mode thread pool facilities to share threads and  wait for messages see section   the operating system uses the local procedure call lpc facility to pass  requests and results between client and server processes within a single  machine in particular lpc is used to request services from the various  windows xp subsystems lpc is similar in many respects to the rpc mech\\xad anisms used by many operating systems for distributed processing across  networks but lpc is optimized for use within a single system the windows  xp implementation of open software foundation osf rpc often uses lpc as  a transport on the local machine  lpc is a message passing mechanism the server process publishes a  globally visible connection port object when a client wants services from a  subsystem it opens a handle to the subsystem s corn ection port object and  sends a connection request to the port the server creates a channel and returns  a handle to the client the charn el consists of a pair of private communication  ports one for client to server messages and the other for server to client  messages communication channels support a callback mechanism so the  client and server can accept requests when they would normally be expecting  a reply  when an lpc channel is created one of three message passing tecl iques  must be specified  the first technique is suitable for small messages up to a few hundred  bytes in this case the port s message queue is used as intermediate  storage and the messages are copied from one process to the other  the second technique is for larger messages in this case a shared\\xad memory section object is created for the channel messages sent through  the port s message queue contain a pointer and size information referring  to the section object this avoids the need to copy large messages the  sender places data into the shared section and the receiver views them  directly  the third teclu ique uses apis that read and write directly into a process s  address space the lpc provides functions and synchronization so that a  server can access the data in a client  the win api window manager uses its own form of message passing  which is independent of the executive lpc facilities when a client asks for  a connection that uses window manager messaging the server sets up three  objects  a dedicated server thread to handle requests  a kb section  object and an event pair object an event pair object is a synchronization    object used by the win api subsysten to provide notification when the client  thread has copied a message to the win api server or vice versa the section  object passes the messages and the event pair object performs synchronization  window manager messaging has several advantages  the section object eliminates message copying since it represents a region  of shared memory  the event pair object eliminates the overhead of using the port object to  pass messages containing pointers and lengths  the dedicated server thread eliminates the overhead of determining which  client thread is calling the server since there is one server thread per client  thread  the kernel gives scheduling preference to these dedicated server threads  to improve performance   i manager  the is responsible for file systems device drivers and network  drivers it keeps track of which device drivers filter drivers and file systems  are loaded and it also manages buffers for i o requests it works with the  vm manager to provide memory mapped file i and controls the windows  xp cache manager which handles caching for the entire i system the  i manager is fundamentally asynchronous providing synchronous i by  explicitly waiting for an i operation to complete the i o manager provides  several models of asynchronous i completion including setting of events  delivery of apcs to initiating threads and use of i completion ports which  allow a single thread to process i completions from many other threads  device drivers are arranged in a list for each device called a driver or  i stack the i manager converts the requests it receives into a standard  form called an it then forwards the irp to the first  driver in the stack for processing after a driver processes the irp it calls the  i manager either to forward the irp to the next driver in the stack or if all  processing is finished to complete the operation on the irp  the i request may be completed in a context different from the one in  which it was made for example if a driver is performing its part of an i  operation and is forced to block for an extended time it may queue the irp to  a worker thread to continue processing in the system context in the original  thread the driver returns a status indicating that the i request is pending  so that the thread can continue executing in parallel with the i operation  an irp may also be processed in interrupt service routines and completed in  an arbitrary context because some final processing may need to take place  in the context that initiated the i the i manager uses an apc to do final  i o completion processing in the context of the originating thread  the stack model is very flexible as a driver stack is built various drivers  have the opportunity to insert themselves into the stack as  filter drivers can examine and potentially modify each l operation mount  management partition management and disk striping and mirroring are all  examples of functionality implemented using filter drivers that execute beneath  the file system in the stack file system filter drivers execute above the file   chapter  system and have been used to implement functionalities such as hierarchical  storage management single instancing of files for remote boot and dynamic  forncat conversion third parties also use file system filter drivers to implement  virus detection  device drivers for windows xp are written to the windows driver model   wdm specification this model lays out all the requirements for device drivers  including how to layer filter drivers share common code for handling power  and plug and play requests build correct cancellation logic and so forth  because of the richness of the wdm writing a full wdm device driver  for each new hardware device can involve an excessive amount of work  fortunately the port miniport model makes it unnecessary to do this within  a class of similar devices such as audio drivers scsi devices or ethernet  controllers each instance of a device shares a common driver for that class  called a the port driver implements the standard operations for  the class and then calls device specific routines in the device s  to implement device specific functionality   cache manager  in many operating systems caching is done by the file system instead  windows xp provides a centralized caching facility the works  closely with the vm manager to provide cache services for all components  under the control of the i manager caching in windows xp is based on files  rather than raw blocks  the size of the cache changes dynamically according to how much free  memory is available in the system recall that the upper gb of a process s  address space comprise the system area it is available in the context of all  processes the vm manager allocates up to one half of this space to the system  cache the cache manager maps files into this address space and uses the  capabilities of the vm manager to handle file i  the cache is divided into blocks of kb each cache block can hold a  view that is a memory mapped region of a file each cache block is described  by a control block vacb that stores the virtual address and  file offset for the view as well as the number of processes using the view the  vacbs reside in a single array maintained by the cache manager  for each open file the cache manager maintains a separate vacb index  array that describes the caching for the entire file this array has an entry for  each kb chunk of the file so for instance a mb file would have an s entry  vacb index array an entry in the vacb index array points to the vacb if that  portion of the file is in the cache it is null otherwise when the i manager  receives a file s user level read request the i manager sends an irp to the  device driver stack on which the file resides the file system attempts to look  up the requested data in the cache manager unless the request specifically asks  for a noncached read the cache manager calculates which entry of that file s  vacb index array corresponds to the byte offset of the request the entry either  points to the view in the cache or is invalid if it is invalid the cache manager  allocates a cache block and the corresponding entry in the vacb array and  maps the view into the cache block the cache manager then attempts to copy  data from the mapped file to the caller s buffer if the copy succeeds the  operation is completed    cached  page fault  figure file  if the copy fails it does so because of a page fault which causes the vm  manager to send a non cached read request to the i manager the i manager  sends another request down the driver stack this time requesting a paging  operation which bypasses the cache manager and reads the data from the file  directly into the page allocated for the cache manager upon completion the  vacb is set to point at the page the data now in the cache are copied to the  caller s buffer and the original i request is completed figure shows an  overview of these operations  when possible for synchronous operations on cached files i is handled  by the mechanism this mechanism parallels the normal irp based  i but calls into the driver stack directly rather than passing down an irp  because no irp is involved the operation should not block for an extended  period of time and cannot be queued to a worker thread therefore when the  operation reaches the file system and calls the cache manager the operation  fails if the information is not already in cache the i manager then attempts  the operation using the normal irp path  a kernel level read operation is similar except that the data can be accessed  directly from the cache rather than being copied to a buffer in user space  to use file system metadata data structures that describe the file system  the kernel uses the cache manager s mapping interface to read the metadata  to the metadata the file system uses the cache manager s pinning  interface a page locks the page into a physical memory page frame  so that the vm manager cannot move or page out the page after updating  the metadata the file system asks the cache manager to unpin the page a  modified page is marked dirty and so the vm manager flushes the page to  disk the metadata are stored in a regular file  to improve performance the cache manager keeps a small history of read  requests and from this history attempts to predict future requests if the cache  manager finds a pattern in the previous three requests such as sequential access  forward or backward it prefetches data into the cache before the next request is  submitted by the application in this way the application finds its data already   chapter  cached and does not need to wait for disk i the win apt openfile and  createfile functions can be passed the file flag sequentialscan flag  which is a hint to the cache manager to try to prefetch kb ahead of the  thread s requests typically windows xp performs i operations in chunks of   kg or pages thus this read ahead is three times the normal amount  the cache manager is also responsible for telling the vm manager to flush  the contents of the cache the cache manager s default behavior is write back  caching it accumulates writes for to seconds and then wakes up the cache\\xad writer thread when write through caching is needed a process can set a flag  when opening the file or the process can call an explicit cache flush function  a fast writing process could potentially fill all the free cache pages before  the cache writer thread had a chance to wake up and flush the pages to disk  the cache writer prevents a process from flooding the system in the following  way wen the amount of free cache memory becomes low the cache manager  temporarily blocks processes attempting to write data and wakes the cache\\xad writer thread to flush pages to disk if the fast writing process is actually a  network redirector for a network file system blocking it for too long could  cause network transfers to time out and be retransmitted this retransmission  would waste network bandwidth to prevent such waste network redirectors  can instruct the cache manager to limit the backlog of writes in the cache  because a network file system needs to move data between a disk and the  network interface the cache manager also provides a dma interface to move  the data directly moving data directly avoids the need to copy data through  an intermediate buffer   security reference monitor  centralizing management of system entities in the object manager enables  windows xp to use a uniform mechanism to perform run time access validation  and audit checks for every user accessible in the system whenever a  process opens a handle to an object the  checks the process s security token and the object s access control list to see  whether the process has the necessary rights  the srm is also responsible for manipulating the privileges in security  tokens special privileges are required for users to perform backup or restore  operations on file systems debug processes and so forth tokens can also be  marked as being restricted in their privileges so that they cannot access objects  that are available to most users restricted tokens are primarily used to restrict  the damage that can be done by execution of untrusted code  another responsibility of the srm is logging security audit events a c  security rating requires that the system have the ability to detect and log all  attempts to access system resources so that it is easier to trace attempts at  unauthorized access because the srm is responsible for making access checks  it generates most of the audit records in the security event log   plug and play and power managers  the operating system uses the plug and play to recognize  and adapt to changes in the hardware configuration for pnp to work both  the device and the driver must support the pnp standard the pnp manager  automatically recognizes installed devices and detects changes in devices as the    system operates the manager also keeps track of resources used by a device  as well as potential resources that could be used and takes care of loading  the appropriate drivers this management of hardware resources primarily  interrupts and i o memory ranges has the goal of determining a hardware  configuration in which all devices are able to operate  for example if device b can use interrupt and device a can use or  then the pnp manager will assign to band to a in previous versions the  user might have had to remove device a and reconfigure it to use interrupt  before installing device b the user thus had to study system resources before  installing new hardware and had to determine which devices were using which  hardware resources the proliferation of pcmcia cards laptop docks and usb  ieee infiniband and other hot pluggable devices also dictates the support  of dynamically configurable resources  the pnp manager handles dynamic reconfiguration as follows first it  gets a list of devices from each bus driver for example pci usb it loads  the installed driver or installs one if necessary and sends an add device  request to the appropriate driver for each device the pnp manager figures out  the optimal resource assignments and sends a start device request to each  driver along with the resource assignment for the device if a device needs to  be reconfigured the pnp manager sends a query stop request which asks the  driver whether the device can be temporarily disabled if the driver can disable  the device then all pending operations are completed and new operations are  prevented from starting next the pnp manager sends a stop request it can  then reconfigure the device with another start device request  the pnp manager also supports other requests such as query remove  this request which is used when the user is getting ready to eject a pccard  device operates in a fashion similar to query stop the surprise remove  request is used when a device fails r more likely when a user removes a  pccard device without stopping it first the remove request tells the driver to  stop using the device and release all resources allocated to it  windows xp supports sophisticated power management although this  feature is useful for home systems to reduce power consumption it is primarily  useful in promoting ease of use quicker access and extending the battery life of  laptops the system and individual devices can be moved to low power mode   called standby or sleep mode when not in use so the battery is primarily  directed at physical memory ram data retention the system can turn itself  back on when packets are received from the network a phone line to a modem  rings or a user opens a laptop or pushes a soft power button windows xp can  also hibernate a system by storing physical memory contents to disk completely  shutting down the machine and then restoring the system at a later point before  execution continues  further strategies for reducing power consumption are supported as well  rather than allowing it to spin in a processor loop when the cpu is idle  windows xp moves the system to a state requiring lower power consumption  if the cpu is underutilized windows xp reduces the cpu clock speed which  can save significant power   registry  windows xp keeps much of its configuration information in an internal  database called the a registry database is called a there are   chapter   separate hives for system information default user preferences software  installation and security because the information in the is  required to boot the system the registry manager is implemented as a  component of the executive  every time the system successfully boots it saves the system hive as last  known good if the user installs software such as a device driver that produces  a system hive configuration that will not boot the user can usually boot using  the last known good configuration  damage to the system hive from installing third party applications and  drivers is so common that windows xp has a component called  that periodically saves the hives as well as other software states like driver  executables and configuration files so that the system can be restored to  a previously working state in cases where the system boots but no longer  operates as expected   booting  the booting of a windows xp pc begins when the hardware powers on and  the bios begins executing from rom the bios identifies the  to be booted and loads and executes the bootstrap loader from the front of  the disk this loader knows enough about the file system format to load the  ntldr program from the root directory of the system device ntldr is used to  determine which contains the operating system next the ntldr  loads in the hal library the kernel and the system hive from the boot device  from the system hive it determines what device drivers are needed to boot  the system the boot drivers and loads them finally ntldr begins kernel  execution  the kernel initializes the system and creates two processes the  contains all the internal worker threads and never executes in user  mode the first user mode process created is smss which is similar to the  init initialization process in unix smss does further initialization of the  system including establishing the paging files and loading device drivers and  creates the winlogon and csrss processes csrss is the win api subsystem  winlogon brings up the rest of the system including the lsass security  subsystem and the remaining services needed to run the system  the system optimizes the boot process by pre loading files from disk based  on previous boots of the system disk access patterns at boot are also used to  lay out system files on disk to reduce the number of i operations required  the processes required to start the system are reduced by grouping services  into one process all of these approaches contribute to a dramatic reduction in  system boot time of course system boot time is less important than it once  was because of the sleep and hibernation capabilities of windows xp which  allow users to power down their computers and then quickly resume where  they left off  environmental subsystems are user mode processes layered over the native  windows xp executive services to enable windows xp to run programs    developed for other operating systems including bit windows ms dos  and posix each environmental subsystem provides a single application  en vironm en t  windows xp uses the win api subsysten as the main operating envi\\xad ronment and thus this subsystem starts all processes when an application is  executed the win api subsystem calls the vm manager to load the appli\\xad cation s executable code the memory manager returns a status to win  indicating the type of executable if it is not a native win api executable the  win api environment checks whether the appropriate environmental sub\\xad system is running if the subsystem is not running it is started as a user mode  process the subsystem then takes control over the application startup  the environmental subsystems use the lpc facility to provide operating\\xad system services to client processes the windows xp subsystem architecture  keeps applications from mixing api routines from different environments for  instance a win api application cam ot make a posix system call because  only one environmental subsystem can be associated with each process  since each subsystem is run as a separate user mode process a crash in one  has no effect on other processes the exception is win api which provides  all keyboard mouse and graphical display capabilities if it fails the system is  effectively disabled and requires a reboot  the win api environment categorizes applications as either graphical or  character based where a character based application is one that thinks interactive  output goes to a character based command window win api transforms  the output of a character based application to a graphical representation in the  command window this transformation is easy whenever an output routine  is called the environmental subsystem calls a win routine to display the  text since the win api environment performs this function for all character\\xad based windows it can transfer screen text between windows via the clipboard  this transformation works for ms dos applications as well as for posix  command line applications   ms dos environment  the ms dos environment does not have the complexity of the other windows  xp environmental subsystems it is provided by a win api application called  the since the vdm is a user mode process it is  and dispatched like any other windows xp application the vdm has  to execute or emulate intel instructions  vdm also provides routines to emulate the ms dos rom bios and   int software interrupt services and has virtual device drivers for the screen  keyboard and communication ports the vdm is based on ms dos source  code it allocates at least kb of memory to the application  the windows xp command shell is a program that creates a window that  looks like an ms dos environment it can run both bit and bit executables  when an ms dos application is run the command shell starts a vdm process  to execute the program  if windows xp is running on a ia compatible processor ms dos graphical  applications run in full screen mode and character applications can run full  screen or in a window not all ms dos applications run under the vdm for  example some ms dos applications access the disk hardware directly so they   chapter  fail to run on windows xp because disk access is restricted to protect the file  system in general ms dos applications that directly access hardware will fail  to operate under windows xp  since ms dos is not a multitasking environment some applications have  been written in such a way as to hog the cpu for instance the use of busy  loops can cause time delays or pauses in execution the scheduler in the kernel  dispatcher detects such delays and automatically throttles the cpu usage but  this may cause the offending application to operate incorrectly   bit windows environment  the win execution environment is provided by a vdm that incorporates  additional software called windows on windows wow for bit applica\\xad tions this software provides the windows kernel routines and stub routines  for window manager and graphical device interface gdi functions the  call the appropriate win api subroutines converting or thunlcing   bit addresses into bit addresses applications that rely on the internal  structure of the bit window manager or gdi may not work because the  underlying win api implementation is of course different from true bit  windows  wow can multi task with other processes on windows xp but it resembles  windows in many ways only one win application can run at a time all  applications are single tlueaded and reside in the same address space and all  share the same input queue these features imply that an application that stops  there are relatively few bit applications that users need to continue to  run on wmdows xp but some of them mclude common installation setup  programs thus the wow environment conti ues to exist primarily because  a number of bit applications cannot be il stalled on windows xp without it   bit windows environment on ia  the native environment for windows on ia uses bit addresses and the  native ia il struction set to execute ia programs in this environment  requires a thunking layer to translate bit win api calls into the correspond\\xad ing bit calls just as bit applications require translation on ia systems  thus bit windows supports the wow environment the implementations  of bit and bit windows are essentially identical and the ia processor  provides direct execution of ia instructions so wow achieves a higher level  of compatibility than wow   win environment  as mentioned earlier the main subsystem in windows xp is the win api  which runs win api applications and manages all keyboard mouse and  screen i since it is the controlling environment it is designed to be extremely  robust several features of the win api contribute to this robushl ess unlike   processes in the win environment each win process has its own input  queue the window manager dispatches all input on the system to the  appropriate process s input queue so a failed process does not block input  to other processes  the windows xp kernel also provides preemptive multitasking which  enables the user to terminate applications that have failed or are no longer  needed the win api also validates all objects before using them to prevent  crashes that could otherwise occur if an application tried to use an invalid or  wrong handle the win api subsystem verifies the type of the object to which  a handle points before using the object the reference counts kept by the object  manager prevent objects from being deleted while they are still being used and  prevent their use after they have been deleted  to achieve a high level of compatibility with windows systems  windows xp allows users to specify that individual applications be run  using a which modifies the win api to better approximate  the behavior expected by old applications for example some applications  expect to see a particular version of the system and fail on new versions  frequently applications have latent bugs that become exposed due to changes  in the implementation running an application with the windows shims  enabled causes the system to provide behavior much closer to windows   though with reduced performance and limited interoperability with other  applications   posix subsystem  the posix subsysten is designed to nm posix applications written to follow  the posix standard which is based on the unix model posix applications can  be started by the win api subsystem or by another posix application posix  applications use posix subsystem server psxss exe the posix dynamic  link library psxdll dll and the posix console session manager po six exe  although tle posix standard does not specify printing posix applications  can use printers transparently via the windows xp redirection mechanism  posix applications have access to any file system on the windows xp system  the posix environment enforces unix like permissions on directory trees  due to scheduling issues the posix system in windows xp does not ship  with the system but is available separately for professional desktop systems  and servers it provides a much higher level of compatibility with unix  applications than previous versions of nt of the commonly available unix  applications most compile and run without change with the latest version of  interix   logon and security subsystems  before a user can access objects on windows xp that user must be authenticated  by the logon service winlogon winlogon is responsible for responding  to the secure attention sequence control alt delete the secure attention  sequence is a required nechanism for keeping an application from acting  as a trojan horse only winlogon can intercept this sequence in order to  put up a logon screen change passwords and lock the workstation to be  authenticated a user must have an account and provide the password   chapter   that account alternatively a user logs on by using a smart card and personal  identification number subject to the security policies in effect for the domain  the local security authority subsystem lsass is the process that generates  access tokens to represent users on the system it calls an  to perform authentication using information from the logon subsystem  or network server typically the authentication package simply looks up the  account information in a local database and checks to see that the password is  correct the security subsystem then generates the access token for the user id  containing the appropriate privileges quota limits and group ids whenever  the user attempts to access an object in the system such as by opening a handle  to the object the access token is passed to the security reference monitor which  checks privileges and quotas the default authentication package for windows  xp domains is kerberos lsass also has the responsibility for implementing  security policy such as strong passwords for authenticating users and for  performing encryption of data and keys  historically ms dos systems have used the file allocation table fat file  system the bit fat file system has several shortcomings including internal  fragmentation a size limitation of gb and a lack of access protection for files  the bit fat file system has solved the size and fragmentation problems  but its performance and features are still weak by comparison with modern  file systems the ntfs file system is much better it was designed to include  many features including data recovery security fault tolerance large files and  file systems multiple data streams unicode names sparse files encryption  journaling volume shadow copies and file compression  windows xp uses ntfs as its basic file system and we focus on it here  windows xp continues to use fat however to read floppies and other  removable media and despite the advantages of ntfs fat continues to  be important for interoperability of media with windows systems  windows xp supports additional file system types for the common formats  used for cd and dvd media   ntfs internal layout  the fundamental entity in ntfs is a volume a volume is created by the  windows xp logical disk management utility and is based on a logical disk  partition a volume may occupy a portion of a disk may occupy an entire  disk or may span several disks  ntfs does not deal with individual sectors of a disk but instead uses clusters  as the units of disk allocation a is a number of disk sectors that is a  power of the cluster size is configured when an ntfs file system is formatted  the default cluster size is the sector size for volumes up to mb kb for  volumes up to gb kb for volumes up to gb and kb for larger volumes  this cluster size is much smaller than that for the bit fat file system and  the small size reduces the amount of internal fragmentation as an example  consider a gb disk with files if you use a fat file system mb    may be lost to internal fragmentation because the cluster size is kb under  ntfs only mb wold be lost when storing the same files  ntfs uses as disk addresses it assigns them  by numbering from the beginning of the disk to the end using this  scheme the system can calculate a physical disk offset in bytes by multiplying  the lcn by the cluster size  a file in ntfs is not a simple byte stream as it is in ms dos or unix rather it  is a structured object consisting of typed each attribute of a file is an  independent byte stream that can be created deleted read and written some  attribute types are standard for all files including the file name or names  if the file has aliases such as an ms dos shortname the creation time and  the security descriptor that specifies access control user data is stored in data  attributes  most traditional data files have an unnamed data attribute that contains all  the file s data however additional data streams can be created with explicit  names for instance in macintosh files stored on a windows xp server the  resource fork is a named data stream the iprop interfaces of the component  object model com use a named data stream to store properties on ordinary  files including thumbnails of images in general attributes may be added as  necessary and are accessed using a file name attribute syntax ntfs returns the  size of the unnamed attribute only in response to file query operations such  as when rmming the dir command  every file in ntfs is described by one or more records in an array stored in a  special file called the master file table mft the size of a record is determined  when the file system is created it ranges from to kb small attributes  are stored in the mft record itself and are called large  attributes such as the unnamed bulk data are called  and are stored in one or more contiguous on the disk a pointer to  each extent is stored in the mft record for a small file even the data attribute  may fit inside the mft record if a file has many attributes or if it is highly  fragmented so that many pointers are needed to point to all the fragments   one record in the mft might not be large enough in this case the file is  described by a record called the which contains pointers to  overflow records that hold the additional pointers and attributes  each file in an ntfs volume has a unique id called a the file  reference is a bit quantity that consists of a bit file number and a bit  sequence number the file number is the record number that is the array slot  in the mft that describes the file the sequence number is incremented every  time an mft entry is reused the sequence number enables ntfs to perform  internal consistency checks such as catching a stale reference to a deleted file  after the mft entry has been reused for a new file   ntfs b tree  as in ms dos and unix the ntfs namespace is organized as a hierarchy of  directories each directory uses a data structure called a to store an  index of the file names in that directory in a b tree the length of every path  from the root of the tree to a leaf is the same and the cost of reorganizing the  tree is eliminated the of a directory contains the top level of the  b tree for a large directory this top level contains pointers to disk extents   chapter  that hold the remainder of the tree each entry in the directory contains the  name and file reference of the file as well as a copy of the update timestamp  and file size taken from the file s resident attributes in the mft copies of this  information are stored in the directory so a directory listing can be efficiently  generated because all the file names sizes and update times are available  from the directory itself there is no need to gather these attributes from the  mft entries for each of the files   ntfs metadata  the ntfs volume s metadata are all stored in files the first file is the mft the  second file which is used during recovery if the mft is damaged contains a  copy of the first entries of the mft the next few files are also special in  purpose they include the files described below  the records all metadata updates to the file system  the contains the name of the volume the version of ntfs that  formatted the volume and a bit that tells whether the volume may have  been corrupted and needs to be checked for consistency  the indicates which attribute types are used in  the volume and what operations can be performed on each of them  the is the top level directory in the file system hierarchy  indicates which clusters on a volume are allocated to files  and which are free  the contains the startup code for windows xp and must be located  at a particular disk address so that it can be found easily by a simple rom  bootstrap loader the boot file also contains the physical address of the  mft  the keeps track of any bad areas on the volume ntfs uses  this record for error recovery   recovery  in many simple file systems a power failure at the wrong time can damage  the file system data structures so severely that the entire volume is scrambled  many versions of unix store redundant metadata on the disk and they recover  from crashes by using the f sck program to check all the file system data  structures and restore them forcibly to a consistent state restoring them  often involves deleting damaged files and freeing data clusters that had been  written with user data but not properly recorded in the file system s metadata  structures this checking can be a slow process and can cause the loss of  significant amounts of data  ntfs takes a different approach to file system robustness in ntfs all file\\xad system data structure updates are performed inside transactions before a data  structure is altered the transaction writes a log record that contains redo and  undo information after the data structure has been changed the transaction  writes a commit record to the log to signify that the transaction succeeded    after a crash the system can restore the file system data structures to  a consistent state by processing the log records first redoing the operations  for committed transactions and then undoing the operations for transactions  that did not commit successfully before the crash periodically usually every   seconds a checkpoint record is written to the log the system does not  need log records prior to the checkpoint to recover from a crash they can be  discarded so the log file does not grow without bounds the first time after  system startup that an ntfs volume is accessed ntfs automatically performs  file system recovery  this scheme does not guarantee that all the user file contents are correct  after a crash it ensures only that the file system data structures the metadata  files are undamaged and reflect some consistent state that existed prior to the  crash it would be possible to extend the transaction scheme to cover user files  and microsoft may do so in the future  the log is stored in the third metadata file at the beginning of the volume  it is created with a fixed maximum size when the file system is formatted it  has two sections the which is a circular queue of log records  and the which holds context information such as the position in  the logging area where ntfs should start reading during a recovery in fact  the restart area holds two copies of its information so recovery is still possible  if one copy is damaged during the crash  the logging functionality is provided by the windows xp   l   in addition to writing the log records and performing recovery actions the  log file service keeps track of the free space in the log file if the free space gets  too low the log file service queues pending transactions and ntfs halts all  new i o operations after the in progress operations complete ntfs calls the  cache manager to flush all data and then resets the log file and performs the  queued transactions   security  the security of an ntfs volume is derived from the windows xp object model  each ntfs file references a security descriptor which contains the access token  of the owner of the file and an access control list which states the access  privileges granted to each user having access to the file  in normal operation ntfs does not enforce permissions on traversal  of directories in file path names however for compatibility with posix  these checks can be enabled traversal checks are inherently more expensive  since modem parsing of file path names uses prefix matching rather than  component by component opening of directory names   volume management and fault tolerance  ftdisk is the fault tolerant disk driver for windows xp when installed it  provides several ways to combine multiple disk drives into one logical volume  so as to improve performance capacity or reliability   volume set  one way to combine multiple disks is to concatenate them logically to form  a large logical volume as shown in figure in windows xp this logical   chapter  disk  gb disk  gb  d disk c fat gb  ilcns  d logical drive d ntfs gb  figure volume set on two drives  volume called a can consist of up to physical partitions a  volume set that contains an ntfs volume can be extended without disturbance  of the data already stored in the file system the bitmap metadata on the ntfs  volume are simply extended to cover the newly added space ntfs continues  to use the same lcn mechanism that it uses for a single physical disk and the  ftdisk driver supplies the mapping from a logical volume offset to the offset  on one particular disk   stripe set  another way to combine multiple physical partitions is to interleave their  blocks in round robin fashion to form a as shown in figure  this scheme is also called raid level or ftdisk uses a stripe  size of kb the first kb of the logical volume are stored in the first  disk gb disk gb  figure stripe set on two drives    disk gb disk gb disk gb  d logical drive c gb  figure stripe set with parity on three drives  physical partition the second kb in the second physical partition and so  on until each partition has contributed kb of space then the allocation  wraps armd to the first disk allocating the second kb block a stripe set  forms one large logical volume but the physical layout can improve the i  bandwidth because for a large i all the disks can transfer data in parallel   stripe set with parity  a variation of this idea is the which is shown in figure   this scheme is also called raid levels suppose that a stripe set has eight  disks seven of the disks will store data stripes with one data stripe on each  disk and the eighth disk will store a parity stripe for each data stripe the parity  stripe contains the byte wise exclusive or of the data stripes if any one of the  eight stripes is destroyed the system can reconstruct the data by calculating the  exclusive or of the remaining seven this ability to reconstruct data makes  the disk array much less likely to lose data in case of a disk failure  notice that an update to one data stripe also requires recalculation of  the parity stripe seven concurrent writes to seven different data stripes thus  require updates to seven parity stripes if the parity stripes were all on the  same disk that disk could have seven times the i load of the data disks to  avoid creating this bottleneck we spread the parity stripes over all the disks by  assigning them in round robin style to build a stripe set with parity we need  a minimum of three equal sized partitions located on three separate disks   disk mirroring  an even more robust scheme is called or raid level it is  depicted in figure a comprises two equal sized partitions  on two disks when an application writes data to a mirror set ftdisk writes  the data to both partitions so that the data contents of the two partitions are  identical if one partition fails ftdisk has another copy safely stored on the  mirror mirror sets can also improve performance because read requests can   chapter  disk gb disk gb  drive c gb copy of drive c gb  figure mirror set on two drives  be split between the two mirrors giving each mirror half of the workload to  protect against the failure of a disk controller we can attach the two disks of a  mirror set to two separate disk controllers this arrangement is called a   sedor sparing and cluster remapping  to deal with disk sectors that go bad ftdisk uses a hardware technique called  sector sparing and ntfs uses a software technique called cluster remapping  is a hardware capability provided by many disk drives when  is formatted it creates a map from logical block numbers to good  sectors on the disk it also leaves extra sectors unmapped as spares if a sector  fails ftdisk instructs the disk drive to substitute a spare  is a software technique performed by the file system if a disk goes  bad ntfs substitutes a different unallocated block by changing any affected  pointers in the mft ntfs also makes a note that the bad block should never be  allocated to any file  when a disk block goes bad the usual outcome is a data loss but sector  sparing or cluster remapping can be combined with fault tolerant volumes to  mask the failure of a disk block if a read fails the system reconstructs the  missing data by reading the mirror or by calculating the exclusive or parity  in a stripe set with parity the reconstructed data are stored in a new location  that is obtained by sector sparing or cluster remapping   compression and encryption  ntfs can perform data compression on individual tlles or on all data files in  a directory to compress a file ntfs divides the file s data into  which are blocks of contiguous clusters when a compression unit  is written a data compression algoritln is applied if the result fits into    fewer than clusters the compressed version is stored when reading ntfs  can determine whether data have been compressed if they have been the  length of the stored compression unit is less than clusters to improve  performance when reading contiguous compression units ntfs prefetches  and decompresses ahead of the application requests  for sparse files or files that contain mostly zeros ntfs uses another  technique to save space clusters that contain only zeros because they have  never been written are not actually allocated or stored on disk instead gaps  are left in the sequence of virtual duster numbers stored in the mft entry for  the file when reading a file if ntfs finds a gap in the virtual duster numbers  it just zero fills that portion of the caller s buffer this technique is also used  by unix  ntfs supports encryption of files individual files or entire directories can  be specified for encryption the security system manages the keys used and a  key recovery service is available to retrieve lost keys   mount points  mount points are a form of symbolic link specific to directories on ntfs they  provide a mechanism for organizing disk volumes that is more flexible than  the use of global names like drive letters a mount point is implemented  as a symbolic link with associated data that contain the true volume name  ultimately mount points will supplant drive letters completely but there  will be a long transition due to the dependence of many applications on the  drive letter scheme   change journal  ntfs keeps a journal describing all changes that have been made to the  file system user mode services can receive notifications of changes to the  journal and then identify what files have changed the content indexing service  uses the change journal to identify files that need to be re indexed the file\\xad replication service uses it to identify files that need to be replicated across the  network   volume shadow copies  windows xp implements the capability of bringing a volume to a known state  and then creating a shadow copy that can be used to back up a consistent view  of the volume making a shadow copy of a volume is a form of copy on write  where blocks modified after the shadow copy is created are stored in their  original form in the copy to achieve a consistent state for the volume requires  the cooperation of applications since the system cannot know when the data  used by the application are in a stable state from which the application could  be safely restarted  the server version of windows xp uses shadow copies to efficiently  maintain old versions of files stored on file servers this allows users to see  documents stored on file servers as they existed at earlier points in time the  user can use this feature to recover files that were accidentally deleted or simply  to look at a previous version of the file all without pulling out a backup tape   chapter    windows xp supports both peer to peer and client server networking it  also has facilities for network management the networking components in  windows xp provide data transport iterprocess communication file sharing  across a network and the ability to send print jobs to remote printers   network interfaces  to describe networking in windows xp we must first mention two of the  internal networking interfaces the  and the  developed in by microsoft and com to separate network adapters  from transport protocols so that either could be changed without affecting  the other ndis resides at the interface between the data link and network  layers in the iso model and enables many protocols to operate over many  different network adapters in terms of the iso model the tdi is the interface  between the transport layer layer and the session layer layer this  interface enables any session layer component to use any available transport  mechanism similar reasoning led to the streams mechanism in unix the  tdi supports both connection based and connectionless transport and has  functions to send any type of data   protocols  windows xp implements transport protocols as drivers these drivers can be  loaded and unloaded from the system dynamically although in practice the  system typically has to be rebooted after a change windows xp comes with  several networking protocols next we discuss a number of the protocols  supported in windows xp to provide a variety of network functionality   server message block  the protocol was first introduced in ms dos  the system uses the protocol to send ii requests over the network the smb  protocol has four message types session control messages are commands  that start and end a redirector corldection to a shared resource at the server a  redirector uses file messages to access files at the server printer messages  are used to send data to a remote print queue and to receive status information  from the queue and message messages are used to communicate with another  workstation the smb protocol was published as the   cifs and is supported on a number of operating systems   network basic input output system  the is a hardware abstraction  interface for networks analogous to the bios hardware abstraction interface  devised for pcs running ms dos netbios developed in the early s  has becmne a standard network programming interface netbios is used to  establish logical names on the network to establish logical connections or  between two logical names on the network and to support reliable  data transfer for a session via either netbios or smb requests     netbios extended user interface  the was introduced by ibm in   as a simple efficient networking protocol for up to machines it is  the default protocol for windows peer networking and for windows for  workgroups windows xp uses netbeui when it wants to share resources with  these networks among the limitations of netbeui are that it uses the actual  name of a computer as the address and that it does not support routing   transmission control protocol internet protocol  the transmission control protocol internet protocol tcp lip suite that is used  on the internet has become the de facto standard networking infrastructure  windows xp uses tcp lip to connect to a wide variety of operating systems  and hardware platforms the windows xp tcp lip package includes the simple  network management protocol snm dynamic host configuration protocol   dhcp windows internet name service wins and netbios support   point to point tunneling protocol  is a protocol provided by  xp to communicate remote access server modules running  on windows xp server machines and other client systems that are connected  over the internet the remote access servers can encrypt data sent over the  connection and they support multi protocol vpns  over the internet   novell netware protocols  then ovell n etware protocols ipx datagram service on the spx transport layer  are widely used for pc lans the windows xp nwlink protocol connects  the netbios to netware networks in combination with a redirector such  as microsoft s client service for netware or novell s netware client for  windows this protocol enables a windows xp client to connect to a netware  server   web distributed authoring and versioning protocol  web distributed authoring and versioning webdav is an http based protocol  for collaborative authoring across a network windows xp builds a webdav  redirector into the file system building this support directly into the file system  enables webdav to work with other features such as encryption personal files  can now be stored securely in a public place   appletalk protocol  the was designed as a low cost connection by apple to  allow macintosh computers to share files windows xp systems can share files  and printers with macintosh computers via apple talk if a windows xp server  on the network is running the windows services for macintosh package   chapter   distributed processing mechanisms  although windows xp is not a distributed operating system it does support  distributed applications mechanisms that support distributed processing on  windows xp include netbios named pipes and mailslots windows sockets  rpcs the microsoft interface definition language and com   netbios  in windows xp netbios applications can communicate over the network using  netbeui nwlink or tcp if   named pipes  are a connection oriented messaging mechanism named pipes  were originally developed as a high level interface to netbios connections over  the network a process can also use named pipes to communicate with other  processes on the same machine since naned pipes are accessed through the  file system interface the security mechanisms used for file objects also apply  to named pipes  the format of pipe names follows the  a unc name looks like a typical remote file name format is   server name share name x y z where server name identifies a server  on the network share name identifies any resource that is made available  to network users such as directories files named pipes and printers and   x y z is a normal file path name   mailslots  are a connectionless messaging mechanism they are unreliable  when accessed across the network in that a message sent to a mailslot may be  lost before the intended recipient receives it mailslots are used for broadcast  applications such as finding components on the network they are also used  by the windows computer browser service   winsock  is the windows xp sockets api winsock is a session layer interface  that is largely compatible with unix sockets but has some added windows xp  extensions it provides a standardized interface to many transport protocols  that may have different addressing schemes so that any winsock application  can run on any winsock compliant protocol stack   remote procedure calls  a remote procedure call rpc is a client server mechanism that enables an  application on one machine to n ake a procedure call to code on another  machine the client calls a local procedure a stub routine which packs its  arguments into a message and sends them across the network to a particular  server process the client side stub routine then blocks meanwhile the server  unpacks the message calls the procedure packs the return results into a  message and sends them back to the client stub the client stub unblocks    receives the message unpacks the results of the rpc and returns them to the  caller this packing of argun lents is sometimes called  the windows xp rpc mechanism follows the widely  computing environment standard for rpc messages so programs written to  use windows xp rpcs are highly portable the rpc standard is detailed it  hides many of the architectural differences among computers such as the sizes  of binary numbers and the order of bytes and bits in computer words by  specifying standard data formats for rpc messages  windows xp can send rpc messages using netbios or winsock on tcp ip  networks or named pipes on lan manager networks the lpc facility  discussed earlier is similar to rpc except that in the case of lpc the messages  are passed between two processes running on the same computer   microsoft interface definition language  it is tedious and error prone to write the code to marshal and transmit  arguments in the standard format to unmarshal and execute the remote  procedure to marshal and send the return results and to unmarshal and return  them to the caller fortunately however much of this code can be generated  automatically from a simple description of the and return results  windows xp provides the to  describe the remote procedure names arguments and results the compiler  for this language generates header files that declare the stubs for the remote  procedures as well as the data types for the arguments and return value  messages it also generates source code for the stub routines used at the client  side and for an unmarshaller and dispatcher at the server side when the  application is linked the stub routines are included when the application  executes the rpc stub the generated code handles the rest   component object model  the is a mechanism for interprocess communication was developed for windows com objects provide a well defined  interface to manipulate the data in the object for instance com is the infras  tructure used by microsoft s technology  for inserting spreadsheets into microsoft documents xp has a  distributed extension called that can be used over a network utilizing  rpc to provide a transparent method of developing distributed applications   redirectors and servers  in windows xp an application can use the windows xp i o api to access  files from a remote computer as though they were locat provided that the  remote computer is running a cifs server such as is provided by windows  xp and earlier windows systems a is the client side object that  forwards i requests to remote files where they are satisfied by a server for  performance and security the redirectors and servers run in kernel mode  in more detait access to a remote file occurs as follows  the application calls the i o manager to request that a file be opened with  a file name in the standard unc format   chapter  the i manager builds an i request packet as described in section     the i manager recognizes that the access is for a remote file and calls a  driver called a  the mup sends the i o request packet asynchronously to all registered  redirectors  a redirector that can satisfy the request responds to the mup to avoid  asking all the redirectors the same question in the future the mup uses a  cache to remember which redirector can handle this file  the redirector sends the network request to the remote system  the remote system network drivers receive the request and pass it to the  server driver  the server driver hands the request to the proper local file system driver  the proper device driver is called to access the data  the results are returned to the server driver which sends the data back  to the requesting redirector the redirector then returns the data to the  calling application via the i o manager  a similar process occurs for applications that use the win api network api  rather than the unc services except that a module called a multi provider router  is used instead of a mup  for portability redirectors and servers use the tdi api for network  transport the requests themselves are expressed in a higher level protocol  which by default is the smb protocol mentioned in section  the list of  redirectors is maintained in the system registry database   distributed file system  unc names are not always convenient because multiple file servers may be  available to serve the same content and unc names explicitly include the name  of the server windows xp supports a protocol  that allows a network administrator to serve up files multiple servers  using a single distributed name space   folder redirection and client side caching  to improve the pc experience for business users who frequently switch among  computers windows xp allows administrators to give users  which keep users preferences and other settings on servers  is then used to auton latically store a user s documents and other files on a  server  this works well until one of the computers is no longer attached to the  network as when a user takes a laptop onto an airplane to give users off line  access to their redirected files windows xp uses  esc is used when the computer is online to keep copies of the server files  on the local machine for better performance the files are pushed up to the  server as they are changed if the computer becomes disconnected the files are    still available and the update of the server is deferred until the next tin le the  computer is online   domains  many networked environments have natural groups of users such as students  in a computer laboratory at school or employees in one department in a  business frequently we want all the members of the group to be able to  access shared resources on their various computers in the group to manage  the global access rights within such groups windows xp uses the concept of  a domain previously these domains had no relationship whatsoever to the  domain name system dns that maps internet host names to ip addresses  now however they are closely related  specifically a windows xp domain is a group of windows xp workstations  and servers that share a common security policy and user database since  windows xp now uses the kerberos protocol for trust and authentication a  windows xp domain is the same thing as a kerberos realm previous versions  of nt used the idea of primary and backup domain controllers now all servers  in a domain are domain controllers in addition previous versions required  the setup of one way trusts between domains windows xp uses a hierarchical  approach based on dns and allows transitive trusts that can flow up and  down the hierarchy this approach reduces the number of trusts required for  n domains from n n to o n the workstations in the domain trust the  domain controller to give correct information about the access rights of each  user via the user s access token all users retain the ability to restrict access to  their own workstations however no matter what any domain controller may  say   domain trees and forests  because a business may have many departments and a school may have  many classes it is often necessary to manage multiple domains within a  single organization a is a contiguous dns naming hierarchy  for managing multiple domains for example bell labs com might be the root of  the tree with research bell labs com and pez bell labs com as children domains  research and pez a is a set of noncontiguous names an example would  be the trees bell labs conz andlucent com a forest may be made up of only one  domain tree however   trust relationships  trust relationships may be set up between domains in three ways one way  transitive and cross link versions of nt through allowed only one way  trusts a is exactly what its name implies domain a is told it  can trust domain b however b will not trust a unless another relationship is  configured under a if a trusts band b trusts c then a b and  call trust one another since transitive trusts are two way by default transitive  trusts are enabled by default for new domains in a tree and can be configured  only among domains within a forest the third type a is useful  to cut down on authentication traffic suppose that domains a and b are leaf  nodes and that users in a often use resources in b if a standard transitive trust   chapter   is used authentication requests must traverse up to the common ancestor of  the two leaf nodes but if a and b have a cross linking trust the authentications  are sent directly to the other node   active directory is the windows xp implementation of  services active directory stores the topology infor\\xad mation about the domain keeps the doncain based user and group accounts  and passwords and provides a domain based store for technologies like  and  administrators use group policies to establish uniform standards for  desktop preferences and software for many corporate information technology  groups uniformity drastically reduces the cost of computing intellimirror is  used in conjunction with group policies to specify what software should be  available to each class of user even automatically installing it on demand from  a corporate server   name resolution in tcp ip networks  on an ip network is the process of converting a computer  name to an ip address such as resolving www bell labs com to   windows xp provides several methods of name resolution including win\\xad dows internet name service wins broadcast name resolution domain name  system dns a hosts file and an lmhosts file most of these methods are used  by many operating systems so we describe only wins here  under wins two or more wins servers maintain a dynamic database of  name to if address bindings along with client software to query the servers  at least two servers are used so that the wins service can survive a server  failure and so that the name resolution workload can be spread over multiple  machines  wins uses the dynamic host configuration protocol dhcp dhcp updates  address configurations automatically in the wins database without user  or administrator intervention as follows when a dhcp client starts up it  broadcasts a discover message each dhcp server that receives the message  replies with an offer message that contains an ip address and configuration  information for the client the client chooses one of the configurations and  sends a request message to the selected dhcp server the dhcp server  responds with the ip address and configuration information it gave previously  and with a for that address the lease gives the client the right to use the  ip address for a specified period of time when the lease time is half expired the  client attempts to renew the lease for the address if the lease is not renewed  the client must obtain a new one  the win api is the fundamental interface to the capabilities of windows  xp this section describes five main aspects of the win api access to  kernel objects sharing of objects between processes process management  interprocess communication and memory management    security attributes sa  sa nlength sizeof sa  sa lpsecuritydescriptor null  sa binherithandle true  handle a semaphore createsemaphore sa  null  char comand line  ostrstream ostring command line sizeof command line  ostring a semaphore ends  createprocess another process exe command line  null null true    figure code enabling a child to share an object by inheriting a handle   access to kernel objects  the windows xp kernel provides many services that application programs  can use application programs obtain these services by manipulating ker\\xad nel objects a process gains access to a kernel object named xxx by calling  the createxxx function to open a handle to xxx this handle is unique to  the process depending on which object is being opened if the create  function fails it may return or it may return a special constant named  invalid jandllvalue a process can close any handle by calling the close\\xad handle function and the system may delete the object if the count of  processes using the object drops to   sharing objects between processes  windows xp provides three ways to share objects between processes the first  way is for a child process to inherit a handle to the object when the parent  calls the createxxx function the parent supplies a securities attributes  structure with the blnheri thandle field set to true this field creates an  inheritable handle next the child process is created passing a value of true  to the createprocess function s binheri thandle argument figure  shows a code sample that creates a semaphore handle inherited by a child  process  assuming the child process knows which handles are shared the parent  and child can achieve interprocess communication through the shared objects  in the example in figure the child process gets the value of the handle  from the first command line argument and then shares the semaphore with  the parent process  the second way to share objects is for one process to give the object a name  when the object is created and for the second process to open the name this  method has two drawbacks windows xp does not provide a way to check  whether an object with the chosen name already exists and the object name  space is global without regard to the object type for instance two applications  nay create an object named pipe when two distinct and possibly different\\xad objects are desired  named objects have the advantage that unrelated processes can readily  share them the first process calls one of the createxxx functions and supplies  a name in the lpszname parameter the second process gets a handle to share   chapter  ii process a  handle a semaphore createsemaphore null  mysem  ii process b  handle b semaphore opensemaphore semaphore all access  false mysem  figure code for sharing an object by name lookup  the object by calling openxxx  or createxxx with the same name as shown  in the example of figure  the third way to share objects is via the duplicatehandle function  this method requires some other method of interprocess communication to  pass the duplicated handle given a handle to a process and the value of a  handle within that process a second process can get a handle to the same  object and thus share it an example of this method is shown in figure   process management  in windows xp a is an executing instance of an application and  a is a unit of code that can be scheduled by the operating system  thus a process contains one or more threads a process is started when  some other process calls the createprocess routine this routine loads  any dynamic link libraries used by the process and creates a  additional threads can be created by the createthread function each  ii process a wants to give process b access to a semaphore  ii process a  handle a semaphore createsemaphore null  null  ii send the value of the semaphore to process b  ii using a message or shared memory object  ii process b  handle process a openprocess process all access false  process id of a  handle b semaphore  duplicatehandle process a a semaphore  getcurrentprocess  b semaphore   false duplicate same access  ii use b semaphore to access the semaphore  figure code for sharing an object by passing a handle    thread is created with its own stack which defaults to mb unless specified  otherwise in an argument to create thread because some c run time  functions maintain state in static variables such as errno a multithread  application needs to guard against unsynchronized access the wrapper  function beginthreadex provides appropriate synchronization   instance handles  every dynamic link library or executable file loaded into the address space of  a process is identified by an the value of the instance handle  is actually the virtual address where the file is loaded an application can get  the handle to a module in its address space by passing the name of the module  to getmodulehandle  if null is passed as the name the base address of  the process is returned the lowest kb of the address space are not used  so a faulty program that tries to de reference a null pointer gets an access  violation  priorities in the win api environment are based on the windows xp  scheduling model but not all priority values may be chosen win api uses  four priority classes  idle priority class priority level  normal priority class priority level  high priority class priority levell  real time priority class priority level  processes are typically members of the normalpriority class unless the  parent of the process was of the idllpridrity class or another class was  specified when createprocess was called the priority class of a process  can be changed with the setpriori tyclass function or by passing of  an argument to the start command for example the command start   realtime cbserver exe would run the cbserver program in the real\\xad time pridrity class only users with the increase scheduling priority privilege  can move a process into the realtimlpriority class administrators and  power users have this privilege by default   scheduling rule  when a user is running an interactive program the system needs to provide  especially good performance for the process for this reason windows xp has a  special scheduling rule for processes in the normalpriority class windows  xp distinguishes between the foreground process that is currently selected on  the screen and the background processes that are not currently selected when  a process moves into the foreground windows xp increases the scheduling  quantum by some factor typically by this factor can be changed via the  performance option in the system section of the control panel this increase  gives the foreground process three times longer to run before a time sharing  preemption occurs   chapter   thread priorities  a thread starts with an initial priority determined by its class the priority  can be altered by the setthreadpriori ty function this function takes an  argument that specifies a priority relative to the base priority of its class  thread priority lowest base  thread priority below normal base  thread priority normal base  thread priority above normal base  thread priority highest base  two other designations are also used to adjust the priority recall from  section  that the kernel has two priority classes for the real\\xad time class and for the variable priority class thread priority idle sets  the priority to for real time threads and to for variable priority threads  thread pridritltimlcritical sets the priority to for real time threads  and to for variable priority threads  as we discussed in section  the kernel adjusts the priority of a  thread dynamically depending on whether the thread is i bound or cpu  bound the win api provides a method to disable this adjustment via  setprocesspriori tyboost and setthreadpriori tyboost functions   thread synchronization  a thread can be created in a the thread does not execute  until another thread makes it eligible via the resumethread function the  suspend thread function does the opposite these functions set a counter so  that if a thread is suspended twice it must be resumed twice before it can nm  to synchronize the concurrent access to shared objects by threads the kernel  provides synchronization objects such as semaphores and mutexes  in addition synchronization of threads can be achieved by use of the wait\\xad forsingleobject and waitformultipleobjects functions another  method of synchronization in the win api is the critical section a critical  section is a synchronized region of code that can be executed by only one thread  at a time a thread establishes a critical section by calling ini tializecri t\\xad icalsection the application must call entercri ticalsection before  entering the critical section and leavecri ticalsection after exiting these  two routines guarantee that if multiple threads attempt to enter the critical  section concurrently only one thread at a time will be permitted to proceed the  others will wait in the entercri ticalsection routine the critical section  mechanism is faster than using kernel synchronization objects because it does  not allocate kernel objects until it first encounters contention for the critical  section   fibers  a is user mode code that is scheduled according to a user defined  scheduling algorithm a process may have multiple fibers in it just as it may    have multiple threads a major difference between threads and fibers is that  whereas threads can execute concurrently only one fiber at a tine is permitted  to execute even on multiprocessor hardware this mechanism is included in  windows xp to facilitate the porting of those legacy unix applications that  were written for a fiber execution model  the system creates a fiber by calling either convertthreadtofi ber  or createfiber the primary difference between these functions is that  createfiber does not begin executing the fiber that was created to begin  execution the application must call swi tchtofiber  the application can  terminate a fiber by calling deletefiber    thread pool  repeated creation and deletion of threads can be expensive for applications and  services that perform small amounts of work in each instantiation the thread  pool provides user mode programs with three services a queue to which work  requests may be submitted via the queueuserworkitern api an api that  can be used to bind callbacks to waitable handles registerwai tforsin\\xad gleobj ect  and apis to bind callbacks to timeouts createtirnerqueue  and createtirnerqueuetirner   the thread pool s goal is to increase performance threads are relatively  expensive and a processor can only be executing one thing at a time no matter  how many threads are used the thread pool attempts to reduce the number of  outstanding threads by slightly delaying work requests reusing each thread  for many requests while providing enough threads to effectively utilize the  machine s cpus the wait and timer callback apis allow the thread pool to  further reduce the number of threads in a process using far fewer threads than  would be necessary if a process were to devote one thread to servicing each  waitable handle or timeout   lnterprocess communication  win api applications handle interprocess communication in several ways  one way is by sharing kernel objects another way is by passing messages  an approach that is particularly popular for windows gui applications one  thread can send a message to another thread or to a window by calling  postmessage postthreadmessage sendmessage sendthreadmes\\xad sage or sendmessagecallback posting a message and sending a message  differ in this way the post routines are asynchronous they return immediately  and the calling thread does not know when the message is actually delivered  the send routines are synchronous they block the caller until the message has  been delivered and processed  in addition to sending a message a thread can send data with the message  since processes have separate address spaces the data must be copied the  system copies data by calling sendmessage to send a message of type  wm copydata with a copydatastruct data structure that contains the length  and address of the data to be transferred when the message is sent windows  xp copies the data to a new block of memory and gives the virtual address of  the new block to the receiving process  unlike threads in the bit windows environment every win api thread  has its own input queue from which it receives messages all input is received   chapter  ii allocate mb at the top of our address space  void buf virtualalloc o ox mem reserve i mem top down  p age readwrite  ii commit the upper mb of the allocated space  virtualalloc buf ox ox mem commit page readwrite  ii do something with the memory  ii now decommit the memory  virtualfree buf ox ox mem decommit  ii release all of the allocated address space  virtualfree buf mem release  figure code fragments for allocating virtual memory  via messages this structure is more reliable than the shared input queue of   bit windows because with separate queues it is no longer possible for  one stuck application to block input to the other applications if a win api  application does not call getmessage to handle events on its input queue the  queue fills up and after about five seconds the system marks the application  as not responding   memory management  the win api provides several ways for an application to use memory virtual  memory memory mapped files heaps and thread local storage   virtual memory  an application calls virtualalloc to reserve or commit virtual memory and  virtualfree to decommit or release the memory these functions enable  the application to specify the virtual address at which the memory is allocated  they operate on multiples of the memory page size and the starting address of  an allocated region must be greater than ox examples of these functions  appear in figure  a process may lock some of its committed pages into physical memory  by calling virtuallock the maximum number of pages a process can lock  is unless the process first calls setprocessworkingsetsize to increase  the maximum working set size   memory mapping files  another way for an application to use memory is by memory mapping a file  into its address space memory mapping is also a convenient way for two  processes to share memory both processes map the same file into their virtual  memory memory mapping is a multistage process as you can see in the  example in figure  if a process wants to map some address space just to share a memory  region with another process no file is needed the process calls create\\xad filemapping with a file handle of oxffffffff and a particular size the  resulting file mapping object can be shared by inheritance by name lookup or  by duplication  figure code fragments for memory mapping of a file   heaps  heaps provide a third way for applications to use memory a heap in the win  environment is a region of reserved address when a win api process  is initialized it is created with a mb since many win api  functions use the default heap access to the heap is synchronized to protect  the heap s space allocation data structures from being damaged by concurrent  updates by multiple threads  win api provides several heap management functions so that a  process can allocate and manage a private heap these functions are  heapcreate  heapalloc  heaprealloc  heapsize  heapfree   and heapdestroy the win api also provides the heaplock and  heapunlock functions to enable a thread to gain exclusive access to a heap  unlike virtuallock  these functions perform only synchronization they  do not lock pages into physical memory   thread local storage  the fourth way for applications to use memory is through a thread local  storage mechanism functions that rely on global or static data typically fail  to work properly in a multithreaded environment for instance the c run\\xad time function strtok uses a static variable to keep track of its current  position while parsing a string for two concurrent threads to execute strt ok  correctly they need separate current position variables the thread local storage  mechanism allocates global storage on a per thread basis it provides both  dynamic and static methods of creating thread local storage the dynamic  method is illustrated in figure  to use a thread local static variable the application declares the variable  as follows to ensure that every thread has its own private copy   declspec thread dword cur pos    chapter   ii reserve a slot for a variable  dword var index tsalloc  ii set it to the value  tssetvalue var index   ii get the value  int var tsgetvalue var index  ii release the index  tsfree var index  figure code for dynamic thread local storage

 now that you understand the fundamental concepts of operating systems cpu  scheduling memory management processes and so on we are in a position  to examine how these concepts have been applied in several older and highly  influential operating systems some of them such as the xds and the the  system were one of a kind systems others such as os are widely used  the order of presentation highlights the similarities and differences of the  systems it is not strictly chronological or ordered by importance the serious  student of operating systems should be familiar with all these systems  as we describe early systems we include references to further reading  the papers written by the designers of the systems are important both for  their technical content and for their style and flavor  to explain how operating system features migrate over time from large  computer systems to smaller ones  to discuss the features of several historically important operating systems  one reason to study early architectures and operating systems is that a feature  that once ran only on huge systems may eventually have made its way i to very  small systems indeed an examination of operating systems for mainframes  and microcomputers shows that many features once available only on main\\xad frames have been adopted for microcomputers the same operating system  concepts are thus appropriate for various classes of computers mainframes  minicomputers microcomputers and handhelds to understand modern oper\\xad ating systems then you need to recognize the theme of feature migration and  the long history of many operating system features as shown in figure  a good example of feature migration started with the multiplexed infor\\xad mation and computing services multics operating system multics was  developed from to at the massachusetts institute of technology as     chapter   figure migration of operating system concepts and features  a computing it ran on a large complex mainframe computer the ge  many of the ideas that were developed for multics were subsequently used at  bell laboratories one of the original partners in the development of multics  in the design of unix the unix operating system was designed around  for a pdp minicomputer around the features of unix became the basis  for unix like operating systems on microcomputers and these features are  included in several more recent operatirlg systems for microcomputers such  as microsoft windows windows xp and the mac osx operating system linux  includes some of these same features and they can now be found on pdas  we turn our attention now to a historical overview of early computer systems  we should note that the history of computing starts far before computers  with looms and calculators as described in frah and shown graphically  in frauenfelder  we begin our discussion however with the computers  of the twentieth century  before the s computing devices were designed and implemented to  perform specific fixed tasks modifying one of those tasks required a great deal  of effort and manual labor all that changed in the s when alan turing and  john von neumann and colleagues both separately and together worked on  the idea of a more general purpose computer such a machine    has both a program store and a data store where the program store provides  instructions about what to do to the data  this fundamental computer concept quickly generated a number of  general purpose computers but much of the history of these machines is  blurred by time and the secrecy of their development during world war ii it  is likely that the first working stored program general purpose computer was  the manchester mark which ran successfully in the first commercial  computer was its offspring the ferranti mark which went on sale in  these early computing efforts are described by rojas and hashagen and  ceruzzi   early computers were physically enormous machines run from consoles  the programmer who was also the operator of the computer system would  write a program and then would operate the program directly from the  operator s console first the program would be loaded manually into memory  from the front panel switches one instruction at a time from paper tape or  from punched cards then the appropriate buttons would be pushed to set the  starting address and to start the execution of the program as the program ran  the programmer i operator could monitor its execution by the display lights on  the console if errors were discovered the programmer could halt the program  examine the contents of memory and registers and debug the program directly  from the console output was printed or was punched onto paper tape or cards  for later printing   dedicated computer systems  as time went on additional software and hardware were developed card  readers lil e printers and magnetic tape became commonplace assemblers  loaders and linkers were designed to ease the programming task libraries  of common functions were created common functions could then be copied  into a new program without having to be written again providing software  reusability  the routines that performed i o were especially important each new i o  device had its own characteristics requiring careful programming a special  subroutine called a device driver was written for each ii device a device  driver knows how the buffers flags registers control bits and status bits for  a particular device should be used each type of device has its own driver  a simple task such as reading a character from a paper tape reader might  involve complex sequences of device specific operations rather than writil g  the necessary code every time the device driver was simply used from the  library  later compilers for fortran cobol and other languages appeared  making the programming task much easier but the operation of the computer  more complex to prepare a fortran program for execution for example  the programmer would first need to load the fortran compiler into the  computer the compiler was normally kept on magnetic tape so the proper  tape would need to be mounted on a tape drive the program would be read  through the card reader and written onto another tape the fortran compiler  produced assembly language output which then had to be assembled this  procedure required mounting another tape with the assembler the output of  the assembler would need to be linked to supporting library routines finally   chapter  the binary object form of the program would be ready to execute it could be  loaded into memory and debugged from the console as before  a significant amount of could be involved in the running of a  job each job consisted of many separate steps  loading the fortran compiler tape  running the compiler  unloading the compiler tape  loading the assembler tape  running the assembler  unloading the assembler tape  loading the object program  running the object program  if an error occurred during any step the programmer operator might have  to start over at the beginning each job step might involve the loading and  unloading of magnetic tapes paper tapes and punch cards  the job set up time was a real problem while tapes were being mounted  or the programmer was operating the console the cpu sat idle remember that  in the early days few computers were available and they were expensive a  computer might have cost millions of dollars not including the operational  costs of power cooling programmers and so on thus computer time was  extremely valuable and owners wanted their computers to be used as much  as possible they needed high to get as much as they could from  their investments   shared computer systems  the solution was twofold first a professional computer operator was hired  the programmer no longer operated the machine as soon as one job was  finished the operator could start the next since the operator had more  experience with mounting tapes than a programmer set up time was reduced  the programmer provided whatever cards or tapes were needed as well as a  short description of how the job was to be run of course the operator could  not debug an incorrect program at the console since the operator would not  understand the program therefore in the case of program error a dump of  memory and registers was taken and the programmer had to debug from the  dump dumping the memory and registers allowed the operator to continue  immediately with the next job but left the programmer with the more difficult  debugging problem  second jobs with similar needs were batched together and run through the  computer as a group to reduce set up time for instance suppose the operator  received one fortran job one cobol job and another fortran job if she ran  them in that order she would have to set up for fortran load the compiler  tapes and so on then set up for cobol and then set up for fortran again if  she ran the two fortran programs as a batch however she could set up only  once for fortran saving operator time    monitor  figure memory layout for a resident monitor  but there were still problems for example when a job stopped the  operator would have to notice that it had stopped by observing the console  determine why it stopped normal or abnormal termination dump memory  and register if necessary load the appropriate device with the next job and  restart the computer during this transition from one job to the next the cpu  sat idle  to overcome this idle time people developed  with this technique the first rudimentary operating systems were  a small program called a moni loj was created to transfer control  automatically from one job to the next figure  the resident monitor is  always in memory or resident  when the computer was turned on the resident monitor was invoked  and it would transfer control to a program when the program terminated it  would return control to the resident monitor which would then go on to the  next program thus the resident monitor would automatically sequence from  one program to another and from one job to another  but how would the resident monitor know which program to execute  previously the operator had been given a short description of what programs  were to be run on what data were introduced to provide this  information directly to the monitor the idea is simple in addition to the  program or data for a job the programmer included the control cards which  contained directives to the resident monitor indicating what program to run  for example a normal user program might require one of three programs to  run the fortran compiler ftn the assembler asm or the user s program   run we could use a separate control card for each of these   ftn execute the fortran compiler   asm execute the assembler   run execute the user program  these cards tell the resident monitor which program to run   chapter  we can use tvw additional control cards to define the boundaries of each  job   job first card of a job   end final card of a job  these two cards might be useful in accounting for the machine resources used  by the programmer parameters can be used to defirte the job name account  number to be charged and so on other control cards can be defined for other  ftmctions such as asking the operator to load or unload a tape  one problem with conh·ol cards is how to distinguish them from data or  program cards the usual solution is to identify them by a special character or  pattern on the card several systems used the dollar sign character  in the  first colun m to identify a control card others used a different code ibm s job  control language jcl used slash marks  in the first two columns figure   shows a sample card deck setup for a simple batch system  a resident monitor thus has several identifiable parts  the is responsible for reading and carrying out  the insh·uctions on the cards at the point of execution  the is invoked by the control card interpreter to load system  programs an d application programs into memory at intervals  the are used by both the control card interpreter and the  loader for the system s i devices often the system and application  programs are linked to these same device drivers providing continuity in  their operation as well as saving memory space and programming time  these batch systems work fairly well the resident monitor provides  automatic job sequencing as indicated by the control cards when a control  card indicates that a program is to be run the monitor loads the program  into memory and transfers control to it when the program completes it  figure card deck for a simple batch system    transfers control back to the monitor which reads the next control card loads  the appropriate program and so on this cycle is repeated until all control  cards are interpreted for the job then the monitor automatically continues  with the next job  the switch to batch systems with automatic job sequencing was made  to improve performance the problem quite simply is that humans are  considerably slower than the computer consequently it is desirable to replace  human operation with operating system software automatic job sequencing  elim inates the need for human set up time and job sequencing  even with this arrangement however the cpu is often idle the problem  is the speed of the mechanical i devices which are intrinsically slower  than electronic devices even a slow cpu works in the n licrosecond range  with thousands of instructions executed per second a fast card reader in  contrast might read cards per minute or cards per second thus the  difference in speed between the cpu and its i devices may be three orders of  magnitude or more over time of course improvements in technology resulted  in faster i devices unfortunately cpu speeds increased even faster so that  the problem was not only unresolved but also exacerbated   overlapped  one common solution to the i problem was to replace slow card readers   input devices and line printers output devices with magnetic tape units  most computer systems in the late s and early s were batch systems  reading from card readers and writing to line printers or card punches the cpu  did not read directly from cards however instead the cards were first copied  onto a magnetic tape via a separate device when the tape was sufficiently full  it was taken down and carried over to the computer when a card was needed  for input to a program the equivalent record was read from the tape similarly  output was written to the tape and the contents of the tape were pri n ted later  the card readers and lilce printers were operated off line rather than the  main computer figure   an obvious advantage of off line operation was that the mam computer  was no longer constrained by the speed of the card readers and line printers  but was limited only by the speed of the much faster magnetic tape units  card reader line printer   a  card reader tape drives tape drives iine printer  figure operation of devices a online and off line   chapter  the technique of using magnetic tape for alll could be applied with any  similar equipment such as card readers card punches plotters paper tape  and printers  the real gain in off line operation comes from the possibility of using  multiple reader to tape and tape to printer systems for one cpu if the cpu  can process input twice as fast as the reader can read cards then two readers  working simultaneously can produce enough tape to keep the cpu busy there  is a disadvantage too however a longer delay in getting a particular job run  the job must first be read onto tape then it must wait until enough additional  jobs are read onto the tape to fill it the tape must then be rewound unloaded  hand carried to the cpu and mounted on a free tape drive this process is not  unreasonable for batch systems of course many similar jobs can be batched  onto a tape before it is taken to the computer  although off line preparation of jobs continued for some time it was  quickly replaced in most systems disk systems became widely available and  greatly improved on off line operation the problem with tape systems was  that the card reader could not write onto one end of the tape while the cpu  read from the other the entire tape had to be written before it was rewound  and read because tapes are by nature devices disk systems  eliminated this problem by being because the head is  moved from one area of the disk to another it can switch rapidly from the area  on the disk being used by the card reader to store new cards to the position  needed by the cpu to read the next card  in a disk system cards are read directly from the card reader onto the  disk the location of card images is recorded in a table kept by the operating  system when a job is executed the operating system satisfies its requests for  card reader input by reading from the disk similarly when the job requests the  printer to output a line that line is copied into a system buffer and is written  to the disk when the job is cmttpleted the output is actually printed this  form of processing is called spooling figure  the name is an acronym for  simultaneous peripheral operation on line spooling in essence uses the disk  as a huge buffer for reading as far ahead as possible on input devices and for  storing output files until the output devices are able to accept them  disk  line printer  figure spooling     spooling is also used for processing data at remote sites the cpu sends  the data via communication paths to a remote printer or accepts an entire  input job from a remote card reader the remote processing is done at its own  speed with no cpu intervention the cpu just needs to be notified when the  processing is completed so that it can spool the next batch of data  spooling overlaps the i o of one job with the computation of other jobs  even in a simple systen l the spooler may be reading the input of one job while  printing the output of a different job during this time still another job or  other jobs may be executed reading its cards from disk and printing its  output lines onto the disk  spooling has a direct beneficial effect on the performance of the system  for the cost of some disk space and a few tables the computation of one job  and the i of other jobs can take place at the same time thus spooling can  keep both the cpu and the i devices working at much higher rates spooling  leads naturally to multiprogramming which is the foundation of all modern  operating systems  the atlas operating system kilburn et al  howarth et al  was  designed at the university of manchester in england in the late s and  early s many of its basic features that were novel at the time have become  standard parts of modern operating systems device drivers were a major  part of the system in addition system calls were added by a set of special  instructions called extra codes  atlas was a batch operating system with spooling spooling allowed the  system to schedule jobs according to the availability of peripheral devices such  as magnetic tape units paper tape readers paper tape punches fuce printers  card readers and card punches  the most remarkable feature of atlas however was its memory manage\\xad ment core was new and expensive at the time many computers  like the ibm used a drum for primary memory the atlas system used a  drum for its main memory but it had a small amount of core memory that was  used as a cache for the drum demand paging was used to transfer information  between core memory and the drum automatically  the atlas system used a british computer with bit words addresses  were bits but were encoded in decimal which allowed only million words  to be addressed at that time this was an extremely large address space the  physical memory for atlas was a kb word drum and kb words of core  memory was divided into word pages providing frames in physical  memory an associative memory of registers implemented the mapping  from a virtual address to a physical address  if a page fault occurred a page replacement algorithm was invoked one  memory frame was always kept empty so that a drum transfer could start  immediately the page replacement algorithm attempted to predict future  memory accessing behavior based on past behavior a reference bit for each  frame was set whenever the frame was accessed the reference bits were read  into memory every instructions and the last values of these bits were   chapter   retained this history was used to define the time since the most recent reference   t and the interval between the last two references t pages were chosen for  replacement in the following order  any page with t t  such a page is considered to be no longer  in use  if t for all pages then replace the page with the largest t t  the page replacement algorithm assumes that programs access memory in  loops if the time between the last two references is t then another reference is  expected t time units later if a reference does not occur t t it is assumed  that the page is no longer being used and the page is replaced if all pages  are still in use then the page that will not be needed for the longest time is  replaced the time to the next reference is expected to be t t  the xds operating system lichtenberger and pirtle  was designed  at the university of california at berkeley like the atlas system it used paging  for memory management unlike the atlas system it was a time shared system  the paging was used only for relocation it was not used for demand paging  the virtual memory of any user process was made up of kb words whereas  the physical memory was made up of kb words each page was made up of   kb words the page table was kept in registers since physical memory was  larger than virtual memory several user processes could be in memory at the  same time the number of users could be increased by sharing of pages when  the pages contained read only reentrant code processes were kept on a drum  and were swapped in and out of memory as necessary  the xds system was constructed from a modified xds the mod\\xad ifications were typical of the changes made to a basic computer to allow an  operating system to be written properly a user monitor ltlode was added  certain instructions such as i and halt were defined to be privileged an  attempt to execute a privileged instruction in user mode would trap to the  operating system  a system call instruction was added to the user mode instruction set  this instruction was used to create new resources such as files allowing the  operating system to manage the physical resources files for example were  allocated in word blocks on the drum a bit map was used to manage  free drum blocks each file had an index block with pointers to the actual data  blocks index blocks were chained together  the xds system also provided system calls to allow processes to create  start suspend and destroy subprocesses a programmer could construct a  system of processes separate processes could share memory for communica\\xad tion and synchronization process creation defined a tree structure where a  process is the root and its subprocesses are nodes below it in the tree each of  the subprocesses could in turn create more subprocesses       the the operating system dijkstra  mckeag and wilson  was  designed at the technische hogeschool at eindhoven in the netherlands it  was a batch system running on a dutch computer the el xs with kb of   bit words the system was mainly noted for its clean design particularly  its layer structure and its use of a set of concurrent processes employing  semaphores for synchronization  unlike those in the xds system however the set of processes in the  the system was static the operating system itself was designed as a set of  cooperating processes in addition five user processes were created that served  as the active agents to compile execute and print user programs when one  job was finished the process would return to the input queue to select another  job  a priority cpu scheduling algorithm was used the priorities were recom\\xad puted every seconds and were inversely proportional to the amount of cpu  time used recently in the last to seconds this scheme gave higher priority  to i o bound processes and to new processes  memory management was limited by the lack of hardware support how\\xad ever since the system was limited and user programs could be written only in  algol a software paging scheme was used the algol compiler automatically  generated calls to system routines which made sure the requested information  was in memory swapping if necessary the backing store was a kb word  drum a word page was used with an lru page replacement strategy  another major concern of the the system was deadlock control the  banker s algorithm was used to provide deadlock avoidance  closely related to the the system is the venus system liskov   the venus system was also a layer structured design using semaphores to  synchronize processes the lower levels of the design were implemented in  microcode however providing a much faster system the memory manage\\xad ment was changed to paged segmented memory the system was also designed  as a time sharing system rather than a batch system  the rc system like the the system was notable primarily for its design  concepts it was designed for the danish computer by regnecentralen  particularly by brinch hansen brinch hansen  brinch hansen   the objective was not to design a batch system or a time sharing system or  any other specific system rather the goal was to create an operating system  nucleus or kernel on which a complete operating system could be built thus  the system structure was layered and only the lower levels comprising the  kernel were provided  the kernel supported a collection of concurrent processes a round robin  cpu scheduler was used although processes could share memory the primary  communication and synchronization itl echanism was the  provided by the kernel processes could communicate with each other by  exchanging fixed sized rnessages of eight words in length all messages were   chapter   stored in buffers from a common buffer pool when a ncessage buffer was no  longer required it was returned to the common pool  a message queue was associated with each process it contained all the  messages that had been sent to that process but had not yet been received  messages were removed from the queue in fifo order the system supported  four primitive operations which were executed atomically  send message in receiver in message out buffer  wait message out sender out message out buffer  send answer out resul in message in buffer  wait answer out result out message in buffer  the last two operations allowed processes to exchange several messages at  a time  these primitives required that a process service its message queue in  fifo order and that it block itself while other processes were handling its  messages to remove these restrictions the developers provided two additional  communication primitives that allowed a process to wait for the arrival of the  next message or to answer and service its queue in any order  wait event in previous buffer out next buffer out result  get event out buffer  i o devices were also treated as processes the device drivers were code  that converted the device interrupts and registers into messages thus a  process would write to a terminal by sending that terminal a message the  device driver would receive the message and output the character to the  terminal an input character would interrupt the system and transfer to  a device driver the device driver would create a message from the input  character and send it to a waiting process  the compatible time sharing system ctss corbato et al  was  designed at mit as an experimental time sharing system it was implemented  on an ibm and eventually supported up to interactive users the  users were provided with a set of interactive commands that allowed them  to manipulate files and to compile and run programs through a terminal  the had a kb memory made up of bit words the monitor used   kb words leaving kb for the users user memory images were swapped  between memory and a fast drum cpu scheduling employed a multilevel\\xad feedback queue algorithm the time quantum for level i was i time units  if a program did not finish its cpu burst in one time quantum it was moved  down to the next level of the queue giving it twice as much time the program  at the highest level with the shortest quantum was run first the initial level  of a program was determined by its size so that the time quantum was at least  as long as the swap time     ibm os  ctss was extremely successful and was in use as late as although  it was limited it succeeded in demonstrating that time sharing was a con\\xad venient and practical mode of computing one result of ctss was increased  development of time sharing systems another result was the development of  multics  the multics operating system corbato and vyssotsky  organick   was designed at mit as a natural extension of ctss ctss and other early  tin e sharing systems were so successful that they created an immediate  desire to proceed quickly to bigger and better systems as larger computers  became available the designers of ctss set out to create a time sharing utility  computing service would be provided like electrical power large computer  systems would be connected by telephone wires to terminals in offices and  homes throughout a city the operating system would be a time shared system  running continuously with a vast file system of shared programs and data  multics was designed by a team from mit ge which later sold its  computer department to honeywell and bell laboratories which dropped  out of the project in the basic ge computer was modified to a  new computer system called the ge mainly by the addition of paged\\xad segmentation memory hardware  in multics a virtual address was composed of an bit segment number  and a bit word offset the segments were then paged in kb word pages  the second chance page replacement algorithm was used  the segmented virtual address space was merged into the file system each  segment was a file segments were addressed by the name of the file the file  system itself was a multilevel tree structure allowing users to create their own  subdirectory structures  like ctss multics used a multilevel feedback queue for cpu scheduling  protection was accomplished through an access list associated with each file  and a set of protection rings for executing processes the system which was  written almost entirely in pl l comprised about lines of code it was  extended to a multiprocessor system allowing a cpu to be taken out of service  for maintenance while the system continued running  the longest line of operating system development is undoubtedly that of ibm  computers the early ibm computers such as the ibm and the ibm are  prime examples of the development of common l subroutines followed by  development of a resident monitor privileged instructions memory protection  and simple batch processing these systems were developed separately often  at independent sites as a result ibm was faced with many different computers  with different languages and different system software  the ibm was designed to alter this situation the ibm was designed  as a family of computers spanning the complete range from small business  machines to large scientific machines only one set of software would be   chapter  needed for these systems which all used the same operating system os   mealy et al  this arrangement was intended to reduce maintenance  problems for ibm and to allow users to move programs and applications freely  from one ibm system to another  unfortunately os tried to be all things for all people as a result it  did none of its tasks especially well the file system included a type field  that defined the type of each file and different file types were defined for  fixed length and variable length records and for blocked and unblocked files  contiguous allocation was used so the user had to guess the size of each output  file the job control language jcl added parameters for every possible  option making it incomprehensible to the average user  the memory management routines were hampered by the architecture  although a base register addressing mode was used the program could access  and modify the base register so that absolute addresses were generated by the  cpu this arrangement prevented dynamic relocation the program was bound  to physical memory at load time two separate versions of the operating system  were produced os mft used fixed regions and os mvt used variable regions  the system was written in assembly language by thousands of program\\xad mers resulting in millions of lines of code the operating system itself required  large amounts of memory for its code and tables operating system overhead  often consumed one half of the total cpu cycles over the years new versions  were released to add new features and to fix errors however fixing one error  often caused another in some remote part of the system so that the number of  known errors in the system remained fairly constant  virtual memory was added to os with the change to the ibm  architecture the underlying hardware provided a segmented paged virtual  memory new versions of os used this hardware in different ways os vsl  created one large virtual address space and ran os mft lie that virtual memory  thus the operating system itself was paged as well as user programs os vs  release ran os mvt in virtual memory finally os vs release which is  now called mvs provided each user with his own virtual memory  mvs is still basically a batch operating system the ctss system was run  on an ibm but the developers at mit decided that the address space of the   ibm s successor to the was too small for multics so they switched  vendors ibm then decided to create its own time sharing system tss lett  and konigsford  like multics tss was supposed to be a large  time shared utility the basic architecture was modified in the model to  provide virtual memory several sites purchased the i in anticipation of  tss  tss was delayed however so other tiine sharing systems were devel\\xad oped as temporary systems until tss was available a time sharing option   tso was added to os ibm s cambridge scientific center developed cms  as a single user system and cp to provide a virtual machine to run it on   meyer and seawright  parmelee et al   when tss was eventually delivered it was a failure it was too large  and too slow as a result no site would switch from its temporary system to  tss today time sharing on ibm systems is largely provided either by tso  under mvs or by cms under cp i renamed vm  neither tss nor multics achieved commercial success what went  wrong part of the problem was that these advanced systems were too large    those systems and more useful for many purposes minicomputers died  out replaced by general and special purpose servers although personal  computers continue to increase in capacity and performance servers tend to  stay ahead of them in amount of memory disk space and number and speed of  available cpus today servers typically run in data centers or machine rooms  while personal computers sit on or next to desks and talk to each other and  servers across a network  the desktop rivalry between apple and microsoft continues today with  new versions of windows and mac os trying to outdo each other in features  usability and application functionality other operating systems such as  amigaos and os have appeared over time but have not been long term  competitors to the two leading desktop operating systems meanwhile linux  in its many forms continues to gain in popularity among more technical users   and even with nontechnical users on systems like the one per  children s connected computer network http i laptop org  for more information on these operating systems and their history see  freiberger and swaine     the mach operating system traces its ancestry to the accent operating system  developedatcarnegiemellon university cmu rashid and robertson   mach s communication system and philosophy are derived from accent but  many other significant portions of the system for example the virtual memory  system and task and thread management were developed from scratch rashid   tevanian et al l and accetta et al  the mach scheduler was  described in detail by tevanian et al a and black  an early version  of the mach shared memory and memory mapping system was presented by  tevanian et al b  the mach operating system was designed with the following three critical  goals in mind   emulate bsd unix so that the executable files from a unix system can  run correctly under mach  be a modern operating system that supports many memory models as  well as parallel and distributed computing   have a kernel that is simpler and easier to modify than is bsd  mach s development followed an evolutionary path from bsd unix sys\\xad tems mach code was initially developed inside the bsd kernet with bsd  kernel components replaced by mach components as the mach components  were completed the bsd components were updated to bsd when that  became available by the virtual memory and communication subsys\\xad tems were running on the dec vax computer family including multiprocessor  versions of the vax versions for the ibm rt pc and for sun workstations  followed shortly then saw the completion of the encore multimax and  sequent balance multiprocessor versions including task and thread support  as well as the first official releases of the system release and release   chapter   through release mach provided compatibility with the corresponding  bsd systems by including much o£ bsd s code in the kernel the new features  and capabilities of mach made the kernels in these releases larger than the  corresponding bsd kernels mach moved the bsd code outside the kernet  leaving a much smaller microkernel this system implements only basic  mach features in the kernel all unix specific code has been evicted to run  in user mode servers excluding unix specific code £rom the kernel allows  the replacement of bsd with another operating system or the simultaneous  execution of multiple operating system interfaces on top of the microkernel in  addition to bsd user mode implementations have been developed for dos the  macintosh operating system and osf this approach has similarities to the  virtual machine concept but here the virtual machine is defined by software   the mach kernel interface rather than by hardware with release mach  became available on a wide variety of systems including single processor sun  intet ibm and dec machines and multiprocessor dec sequent and encore  systems  mach was propelled to the forefront of industry attention when the open  software foundation osf announced in that it would use mach as  the basis for its new operating system osf mach was also the basis for  the operating system on the next workstation the brainchild of steve jobs of  apple computer fame the initial release of osf occurred a year later and  this system competed with unix system v release the operati j l g system  of choice at that time among unix international ui members osf members  i j l cluded key technological companies such as ibm dec and hp osf has since  changed its direction and only dec l jn ix is based on the mach kernel  unlike unix which was developed without regard for multiprocessing  mach incorporates multiprocessing support throughout this support is also  exceedingly flexible ranging £rom shared memory systems to systems with  no memory shared between processors mach uses lightweight processes  in the form of multiple threads of execution within one task or address  space to support multiprocessing and parallel computation its extensive  use of messages as the only communication method ensures that protection  mechanisms are complete and efficient by integrating messages with the  virtual memory system mach also ensures that messages can be handled  efficiently finally by having the virtual memory system use messages to  communicate with the daemons managing the backing store mach provides  great ±exibility in the design and implementation of these memory object\\xad managing tasks by providing low level or primitive system calls from which  more complex functions can be buik mach reduces the size of the kernel  while permitting operating system emulation at the user levet much like ibm s  virtual machine systems  some previous editions of operating system concepts included an entire  chapter on mach this chapter as it appeared in the fourth edition is available  on the web http i lwww os book com  there are of course other operating systems and most of them have inter\\xad esting properties the mcp operating system for the burroughs computer    family mckeag and wilson  was the first to be written in a system \\xad programming language it supported segmentation and multiple cpus the  scope operating system for the cdc mckeag and wilson  was  also a multi cpu system the coordination and synchronization of the multiple  processes were surprisingly well designed  history is littered with operating systems that suited a purpose for a time   be it a long or a short time and then when faded were replaced by operating  systems that had more features supported newer hardware were easier to use  or were better marketed we are sure this trend will continue in the future   consider the page replacement algorithm used by atlas in what ways  is it different from the clock algorithm discussed in section    consider the multilevel feedback queue used by ctss and multics  suppose a program consistently uses seven time units every time it  is scheduled before it performs an l operation and blocks how  many time units are allocated to this program when it is scheduled for  execution at different points in time   what optimizations were used to minimize the discrepancy between  cpu and i o speeds on early computer systems   what conclusions can be drawn about the
